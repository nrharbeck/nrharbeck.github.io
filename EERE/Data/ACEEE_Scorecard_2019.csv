","Building type(s) affected: residential
SB 2746 requires the disclosure of information regarding the benefits of home energy audits to buyers of single-family homes or small multi-family homes at the time of closing.

DOER has been piloting a Building Asset Rating (BAR) reporting protocol to serve as a next step for cities that have a disclosure ordinance in place. The BAR pilot has completed assessments of 41 commercial office building and has developed protocols for these building assessments.

Through the Home Energy Labeling Information Exchange (HELIX) DOER is partnering with the Vermont Public Service Department and other Northeast states to make U.S. DOE Home Energy Score (HES) data accessible to local Multiple Listing Services (MLS) and other market interests (e.g., assessors, appraisers, lenders) through a publicly accessible database. The project will support the market valuation of energy efficiency in homes and kicked off in late April 2016. HELIX is supported by a U.S. DOE award of $786,103 (over three years), and by funds provided by DOER, as well as DOER staff time.

In addition, through the Energy Metrics to Promote Residential Energy Scorecards in the States (EMPRESS), the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources (RI OER), and the National Association of State Energy Offices (NASEO) will further work to develop common building energy labeling infrastructure by harmonizing the Home Energy Rating System (HERS) used for new homes and the DOE Home Energy Score (HES) used for existing homes. Both HELIX and EMPRESS build from a DOE-funded two year pilot, called Home MPG, completed in 2014. Home MPG was a collaboration between DOER and three investor-owned utilities in which over 3866 homes received home energy performance scores (EPS) through the Mass Save home energy audit program, and 1593 of those homes (41%) received an updated EPS after completing efficiency upgrades.

In 2018, Governor Baker introduced bill number H. 4371 in the Massachusetts Legislature that would require home energy scorecards to be part of an MLS listing.

","Massachusetts has several green building programs targeted at state buildings. Executive Order 484 (2007) requires a reduction in overall energy consumption in state-owned and leased buildings (at which the state pays directly for energy) by 20% by fiscal year 2012 and 35% by 2020 (based on a fiscal year 2004 baseline). In Fiscal Year 2018, continued progress in state buildings resulted in additional efficiency gains with a cumulative EUI reduction of 13% from a 2004 site EUI. The state publicly tracks progress towards EO 484 targets.

The executive order states that all state agency new construction and major renovations over 20,000 sq. ft. must meet the MA LEED Plus green building standard and perform 20% better than the current energy code. Currently, there are 86 LEED certified buildings in the state portfolio, including 4 Platinum and 52 Gold certifications. Five state buildings have now been built to the zero net energy (ZNE) standard and energy use data collected over the past several years shows that three of them met the ZNE standard in 2018, producing more renewable energy on-site than was consumed by the building over the course of a year.

The Green Communities Act (S.B. 2768) of 2008 mandates that new buildings owned or operated by the state must minimize their life-cycle costs by using energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Since 2013, the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM) has overseen the completion of 75 energy projects in over 33.3 million square feet of state buildings, more than half the state building portfolio. These completed projects represent an investment of $242.3 million and will save the Commonwealth approximately $12.4 million and 448,000 MMBtu annually. The 75 energy projects consist of 41 Comprehensive Design-Build/Retro-Commissioning projects and 34 bundles of small energy projects at 336 sites. Collectively, these projects reduce GHG emissions by almost 36,000 metric tons annually. Efficiency measures include, but are not limited to, LED lighting retrofits and lighting controls, insulation and weatherization, window replacements, boiler replacements, heating, ventilation and air conditioning and mechanical upgrades, and more. Many of these projects also include the installation of renewable heating and cooling technologies, including biomass, air and ground source heat pumps, and solar thermal.

The State’s Enterprise Energy Management System (EEMS) project, awarded to EnerNOC in April 2010, was the first-phase of the largest public sector undertaking to measure real-time energy use information at 25 million square feet of buildings, tracking and comparing building energy consumption across a third of the state’s building portfolio and enabling responses to energy anomalies on a real-time basis. The innovative program’s second-phase, known as Commonwealth Building Energy Intelligence (CBEI), is working to build upon previous efforts and revamp the way state buildings use and respond to energy information. CBEI includes technological and strategic enhancements for advanced building energy metering tracking and analytics in an effort to drive operational efficiencies at state facilities. In 2016, the Commonwealth signed a $5.6 million, three-year contract with EnerNOC to provide these and other advanced energy intelligences services for millions of square feet of Commonwealth facilities. EnerNOC provides state facilities with access to real-time metering, building management system integration, utility bill management, and building energy analytics, enabling them to optimize day-to-day energy management, identify energy anomalies as they occur, prioritize energy projects that target under-performing buildings, and identify billing errors on utility bills. The contract is managed by the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM), with close collaboration with DOER. The contract provides substantial advancements in energy intelligence approaches, with the goal to significantly reduce energy use and costs at state facilities. This past year, extensive work has been done setting up a utility bill management program, and collaborating with individual state sites to identify and implement operational efficiency measures and analyzing peak demand and costs. Efforts such as targeting building shutdowns during holidays and weekends, load cycling, and optimizing building start up/shut down times have saved an estimated 6.8 million kWh and $886,565 in energy costs at 92 buildings , with additional operational strategies underway at these and other sites across the state portfolio. When CBEI contract features are fully implemented, the program is expected to result in at least 5-10% energy use reductions across these sites, saving millions in energy costs. DCAMM has extended the contract with ENEL X (formerly EnerNOC) for 2 additional years through March 2021.

The state’s Green Communities Division has also developed and implemented MassEnergyInsight, a free, web-based tool that helps cities and towns make informed, targeted decisions about energy efficiency investments. MassEnergyInsight provides communities with customized electricity, natural gas, and oil usage information to allow local officials to understand where their departments and buildings are wasting energy and act to reduce that waste. The State’s Leading by Example program utilizes two databases for the benchmarking and tracking of state facilities. The LBE database tracks 100% of the roughly 80 million square feet of state-owned facilities across the Commonwealth. Data are retrieved from a variety of sources, including statewide fuel contracts, utility accounts, Commonwealth Building Energy Intelligence, MassEnergyInsight, and an annual energy tracking form distributed to campuses and agencies to facilitate self-reporting. MassEnergyInsight functions as the second primary database used for tracking and benchmarking of state facilities, providing monthly, site-level utility account data for over 70% of square footage at state facilities.

Massachusetts is a partner in the US Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge (BBC), a voluntary program which sets long range energy reduction targets for a select portfolio of buildings, requires the state to track and report detailed energy use at its facilities annually, and develop and document one or more showcase projects that demonstrate best practices and far-reaching energy strategies.

Although not formally a requirement, as part of the continued efforts to push new building energy use far below code, the Commonwealth continues to promote the design and construction of zero net energy (ZNE) buildings. With five buildings in the state portfolio that have been designed to this standard, buildings are employing a range of innovative technologies and strategies that include cold climate air and ground source heat pumps, all LED lighting, solar PV and solar thermal, chilled beams and sophisticated building controls, to name just a few. Data from 2018 shows that three of these buildings (Walden Pond Visitor Center, Bristol Community College Sbrega Health and Science Building, and Division of Fisheries and Wildlife Headquarters) all met the ZNE standard, generating between 100 and 155 percent of annual consumption from on-site renewable energy. These buildings are operating extremely efficiently with actual EUIs of 25-46, well below the average EUIs for each building type.

","The Green Communities Act requires the state to purchase hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles in such numbers that 50% of the fleet is hybrid or AFV by 2018. In addition, the Green Communities Act also requires the development of a fuel efficiency standard (FES) for the state fleet. This standard was developed and approved by DOER and the Operational Services Division and encompasses the state's entire light duty fleet of more than 2,800 vehicles. The FES requires agencies to acquire: passenger cars that meet an average MPG of 32; trucks, vans and SUVs under 8500 lbs that meet and average MPG of 22; and vehicles between 8,500 and 10,000 lbs that meet and average MPG of 16. The standard is accompanied by an innovative calculator that allows fleet managers to input desired vehicles and immediately see whether or not their acquisitions will meet the standard. DOER has hosted webinars and one-on-one trainings to help fleets understand and comply with the standard.  In Fiscal Year 2017, the state’s light duty fleet realized efficiency gains of 32% while saving the Commonwealth approximately $50,000 in upfront vehicle costs. In addition, compared to the vehicles replaced, the new vehicle acquisitions are projected to save agencies $34,000 in fuel costs and 15,000 gallons of gasoline annually.

The statewide vehicle contract, managed by the Operational Services Division, provides public entities with greater access to fuel efficient vehicles. This statewide vehicle contract has made an array of fuel-efficient hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles available for purchase by any state agency, campus, or municipality. Included on this contract are 4133 models that get 30 mpg or better, 1014 hybrid electric models, 6 plug-in hybrid electric models, 3model, 4 electric only vehicles, and 63 vehicles that run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).

In addition, DOER and the Operational Services Division re-opened the Advanced Vehicle Technologies statewide contract to solicit additional vendors that provides access to after-market hybrid and alternative fuel conversion technologies, electric vehicle charging stations, and idle reduction technologies. This contract now includes 13 vendors that offer public entities an expanded range of options for reducing vehicle petroleum consumption, particularly for vehicle types with limited fuel-efficient options available commercially, such as pick-up trucks and heavy-duty vans. Through a State Fleet Efficiency grant program, the state’s Leading by Example Program supported the after-market hybrid conversion of 25 heavy-duty passenger and cargo vans in the Executive Branch state fleet.

Lastly, as the electric vehicle market transforms and requires new infrastructure to support these vehicles, LBE works with agencies and higher ed campuses to address opportunities to integrate electric vehicle charging stations at their facilities. Firstly, any state solar canopy project that receives funding through the LBE solar grant program must install 2 EV charging stations as a requirement of the grant award. Additionally, LBE has been working on an electric vehicle & EVSE guidance document to help agencies and campuses navigate the complex process of selecting, siting and acquiring funding for potential EVs and EVSE. As of May 2019, there are 108 electric vehicle charging stations at state facilities, including 100 level 2 chargers and 8 fast chargers.

","In 2007, Executive Order 484 was signed, setting aggressive targets for reductions in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, and increases in use of renewable energy across state government operations. It included a provision that directed state agencies to implement ESPCs for all facilities larger than 100,000 square feet. The Department of Administration and Finance houses the ESPC Program under its sub-Department of Capital and Asset Management and Maintenance (DCAMM). Massachusetts offers some model documents, including a model contract.

Through the DCAMM-DOER Accelerated Energy Program which began in 2012, a total of some $470 million in energy investments will be made for projects across 58 million square feet of state buildings, resulting in a 25% energy reduction and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions totaling 135,000 metric tons. Municipalities also utilize energy saving performance contracts through the Department of Energy Resources (DOER). The agency provides procurement guidance and oversight, a manual and model procurement documents that regulate the process. Most municipal projects include both school and municipal sites under one ESPC project. Projects include energy and water conservation and efficiency upgrades including nontraditional measures such solar onsite energy generation and street lighting. To date, local governmental bodies have invested in almost $485 million in projects representing over $23 million in annual cost savings.

Additionally, DOER signed onto the DOE Better Buildings Performance Contracting Accelerator, pledging at least $350 million toward energy projects at state and municipal buildings between 2013 and 2016. Under this program to date, 93 state and municipal projects are underway, representing an investment of more than $265 million, or nearly 76% of the full commitment. Of these, 36 are state projects and 57 are municipal projects, estimated to save these entities more than $9 million and $5.8 million in annual energy costs, respectively. In 2016, Massachusetts surpassed its commitment for the ESPC Accelerator and was named one of the Energy Steward Champions by the Energy Services Coalition.

","Incentives, grants, or financing: Through the Mass Save CHP Program, CHP system owners have access to three tiers of incentives – basic, moderate, and advanced – and each tier provides a greater reward to systems that are sized and designed to achieve ideal performance and cost-effectiveness. Incentives range from $750/kW to $1,200/kW and cannot exceed 50% of total project costs.

Net metering: In Massachusetts net metering was originally authorized for renewable-energy systems and combined-heat-and-power (CHP) facilities with a generating capacity up to 30 kilowatts (kW) by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) in 1982. In 1997, the maximum individual system capacity was raised to 60 kW and customers were permitted to carry any net excess generation to the next bill. In July 2008, net metering was significantly expanded by S.B. 2768 and the DPU adopted rules implementing the law in June 2009Net metering was significantly expanded as part of the Green Communities Act of 2008 and was further modified in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. Current net metering caps are set at 7% of historical peak load for private facilities and 8% of historical peak load for public facilities.

The DPU adopted amended net-metering rules in July 2009. In August 2009, the DPU issued its model net metering tariff so that customers in Massachusetts are subject to the same net metering tariffs regardless of utility. The state's investor-owned utilities must offer net metering. Municipal utilities are not obligated to offer net metering, but they may do so voluntarily. The aggregate capacity of net metering is limited to 1% of each utility’s peak load.

CHP systems under 60 kW are eligible as ""Class I"" systems for net metering in Massachusetts.

",20 out of 20,"Massachusetts is a leading state with a long, successful record of implementing energy efficiency programs for all customer sectors. The state created an aggressive funding mechanism and required electric utilities to provide energy efficiency programs during its restructuring of the industry in 1997. The natural gas utilities in the state have offered energy efficiency programs to customers since the late 1980s.

In 2008, the governor signed Chapter 169 of the Acts of 2008, An Act Relative to Green Communities. The new law altered the approval process and timeline for electric and natural gas utility energy efficiency plans and required the utilities to file the plans every three years. The law required the state’s regulatory authority, the Department of Public Utilities, to ensure that energy efficiency programs “are delivered in a cost-effective manner capturing all available efficiency opportunities, minimizing administrative costs to the fullest extent practicable, and utilizing competitive procurement processes to the fullest extent practicable.” In addition, the law directed the DPU to appoint and convene an Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC), whose members play a key role in designing, approving, and monitoring the energy efficiency programs of Massachusetts' investor-owned utilities. The EEAC’s primary mandate is achieving the goals outlined in the Green Communities Act and developing long-term vision, including recommendations concerning studies and research to achieve the goals of acquiring all cost-effective efficiency that is less than the cost of generation, and maximizing economic and environmental benefits that can be realized through increased energy efficiency.

Massachusetts' approach has resulted in one of the most ambitious fully-funded state savings targets, with incremental electric savings targets averaging 2.7% from 2019-2021. The state’s three year plan also includes gas savings of about 1.25% of retail sales each year. Utility companies in the state manage and implement efficiency programs. The low-income residential demand-side management and education programs are implemented in conjunction with the state’s low-income weatherization and fuel assistance program.

Ten years after the Green Communities Act was signed, the governor signed Chapter 227 of the Acts of 2018, An Act to Advance Clean Energy.  This law positioned Massachusetts's energy efficiency programs to address current challenges related to climate and technology changes by decreasing dependence on fossil fuels and actively managing energy loads in real-time. Starting in 2019, electric efficiency program administrators have committed to an integrated electricity and fuel savings goal of 120.4 site MMBtu over 3 years. In addition, they have committed to actively managing 200MW of electricity in the summer and 50MW in the winter.

Massachusetts has decoupling in place for all of its gas and electric utilities. Shareholder incentives are in place for electric and gas utilities. The shareholder incentive provides performance incentives for IOUs to earn a return (depending on PA performance against planned metrics) on the 3-year plan spending for meeting program goals. The incentive is based on a combination of elements including energy savings, benefit-cost analysis, and market transformation results.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

The distribution utilities administer their own energy efficiency programs with collaborative input and oversight from the Massachusetts Energy Efficiency Advisory Council, a stakeholder body chaired by the state Department of Energy Resources (DOER). The Department of Public Utilities has regulatory responsibility.

All investor-owned gas and electric utilities and energy efficiency program administrators have partnered together to sponsor the Mass Save® program. Administrators work with the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to provide a wide range of services, incentives, trainings, and information promoting energy efficiency. A variety of electric and gas efficiency programs are also offered directly through IOUs and municipal utilities. Some municipal utilities also offer energy efficiency programs. Energy efficiency program funds must be allocated to customer classes, including the low-income residential subclass, in proportion to these customers’ contributions to those funds. At least 10% of the funding for electric energy efficiency programs and at least 20% of the funding for gas energy efficiency programs must be spent on low-income residential demand-side management and education programs.

The first electric efficiency procurement plan called for incremental savings 1.0% in 2009, 1.4% in 2010, 2.0% in 2011, and 2.4% in 2012. The state's fourth three-year plan calls for savings to average 2.7% of annual sales. The energy efficiency investments in 2019-2021 are expected to save 3,461 annual GWh of electricity by 2021. The statewide totals are comprised of individual program administrator savings.

The state's natural gas plan will save 95.9 MMTherms over the 2019 to 2021 plan period (equivalent to 1.2% of sales).

Overall, the fully funded 2019-2021 electric and natural gas efficiency procurement plans will yield net consumer benefits of nearly $8.56 billion.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Massachusetts relies on both legislative mandates (Green Communities Act of 2008) and regulatory orders (DPU 8-50-A). The order follows the legislation. Updates to rules were made in DPU 11-120, a supplement to 08-50. Evaluations are mainly administered by the Energy Efficiency Program Administrators through an Evaluation Management Committee, which includes a representative from each PA. However, the Massachusetts’s Energy Efficiency Advisory Council oversees the evaluations. Statewide evaluations are conducted except for PA-specific pilots. The state maintains an electronic Technical Reference Manual (eTRM) for information on methods, formulas, and default assumptions for estimating energy, peak demand, and other resource impacts from energy efficiency measures. 



According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Massachusetts relies on the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test as its primary test for decision making. Resource and non-resource benefits are determined through the EM&V process to be included in the TRC and approved by the DPU. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in the?Green Communities Act of 2008?and?DPU 8-50-A and were amended by the Act to Advance Clean Energy of 2018. Benefit-cost tests are required at the overall sector levels screening. Massachusetts’ test accounts for avoided costs of compliance with emissions regulations and participant health benefits resulting from installed measures. Massachusetts’ TRC accounts for non-energy costs and benefits associated with asset value, productivity, economic well-being (reduced arrearages, terminations and reconnections), comfort, other fuels (natural gas, oil, propane, wood), and water savings. 




Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Massachusetts is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP). Further information on health and environmental benefits is available in ACEEE’s Overview of State Approaches to Account for Health and Environmental Benefits of Energy Efficiency.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In the late 1990s, Massachusetts restructuring law established a low-income conservation fund through a 0.25 mills per kWh charge on every electric customer, while a conservation charge on natural gas customers’ bills has funded natural gas low-income energy efficiency programs.

In 2010, the program received additional funding through the 2008 Green Communities Act, which required that 10% of electric utility program funds and 20% of gas program funds be spent on comprehensive low-income energy efficiency and education programs. The legislation further directed that these programs be implemented through the low-income weatherization and fuel assistance program network with the objective of standardizing implementation among all utilities.

Low-income residents are served through the statewide ratepayer-funded energy efficiency program called Mass Save®.  More specifically, the Income Eligible Coordinated Delivery initiative provides cost-effective, energy efficiency products and services to income eligible residential customers in a fuel blind approach. Income eligible is defined as at or below 60 percent of the state median income level for 1-4 unit buildings and at or below 60 percent of the area median income level for 5+ unit buildings. Customers that qualify for the utility discount rate are also considered income eligible. Customers qualify for the utility discount rate by meeting low-income home energy assistance (“LIHEAP”) eligibility or by meeting the eligibility requirements for other means-tested programs, such as Chapter 115 Veterans’ Service Benefits, Supplemental Security Income, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program services.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Massachusetts relies on the TRC test as its primary test for DSM programs, but it specifically calculates additional benefits from low-income programs in its benefit-cost ratio.

D.P.U. 08-50-B specifies that an Energy Efficiency Plan must include calculations of non-energy benefits, including non-resource benefits related to: “(A) reduced costs for operation and maintenance associated with efficient equipment or practices; (B) the value of longer equipment replacement cycles and/or productivity improvements associated with efficient equipment; (C) reduced environmental and safety costs, such as those for changes in a waste stream or disposal of lamp ballasts or ozone-depleting chemicals; and (D) all benefits associated with providing energy efficiency services to Low-Income Customers.”

The cost-effectiveness evaluation for the current low-income programs in Massachusetts includes consideration of non-energy benefits such as asthma reductions, thermal stress reductions, productivity improvements due to fewer missed workdays and improved sleep, reduced risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, reduced risk of fire, and reduced reliance on high interest, predatory loans.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

Coordination occurs through the Massachusetts Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN), which was established by the lead agencies of the low-income weatherization and fuel assistance program network. LEAN works to standardize eligibility requirements, procedures, and standards to enable delivery of various programs through CAP agencies throughout the state. The ratepayer funded low-income programs (i.e., the Income Eligible Coordinated Delivery initiative within Mass Save) is administered in coordination with LEAN and implemented by local Community Action Program (“CAP”) Agencies. Revenue streams are leveraged with the Department of Housing and Community Development (“DHCD”) Weatherization Assistance Program (“WAP”) and the Heating Emergency Assistance Retrofit Task Weatherization Assistance program (“HEARTWAP”). This approach provides a seamless, integrated experience leveraging all applicable revenue streams for income eligible participants with no co-payments required from customers.

Target revenues are determined on a utility-wide basis, and can be adjusted for inflation or capital spending requirements if necessary. The Massachusetts DPU has approved decoupling plans for National Grid Electric Company (DPU 09-39), National Grid Gas Company (DPU 10-55), Bay State Gas Company (DPU 09-30) and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (DPU 10-70). Each distribution company is required to institute a decoupling mechanism with its next filed rate case.

Shareholder incentives are in place for electric and gas utilities. The shareholder incentive provides performance incentives for IOUs to earn a return (depending on PA performance against planned metrics) on the 3-year plan spending for meeting program goals. The incentive is based on a combination of elements including energy savings, benefit-cost analysis, and market transformation results. The shareholder incentive structure was amended by DPU Order 11-120-A. The current performance incentive parameters may be found in the 2019-2021 term sheet.

There has been an ongoing process to develop a statewide energy efficiency database that would potentially include customer energy use data, but there is no regulation in place to date.

Requirements for Provision of Energy Data

To date, there is no regulation in place for provision of meter data. The interactive program data tool at MassSaveData.com, which is administered by the PAs, includes customer energy use data by sector (residential, low income, and C&I) and separately by municipality. MassSaveData.com only presents estimated annual aggregate sales numbers. Chapter 465 of the Acts of 1980 allows residential energy audit report information to be given to tenants or subsequent purchasers. DOER is in the process of updating the regulation to systematize that process. Although provision of energy use data to customers is not required, 86% of the state's electric customers and 71% of the state's gas customers have access to Green Button data through voluntary utility participation.

In the City of Boston and the City of Cambridge, there are building disclosure ordinances, and those cities have requested that the electric and gas utilities provide multi-tenant building data in aggregated form. There are no statewide requirements.

Energy Use Data Availability

The state does not have a standardized system through which access to individual or aggregated energy use data may be requested except in the cities of Cambridge and Boston.

Description: Having originally adopted standards in 1986, Massachusetts was one of the first states to adopt appliance standards after California paved the way in 1974. In 2005, Massachusetts expanded its appliance standards legislation to cover seven products. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, however, introduced standards that preempted state standards for five of those products. New products that are considered for state standards are adopted through the Division of Energy Resources (DOER). 

In 2009, Massachusetts developed an application for a waiver of federal standards for gas furnace (and fans) minimum efficiency in order to implement its own, more stringent, standard; it is the only state to have done so. Their waiver application helped spur manufacturer interest in a negotiated federal standard. Federal standards preempted Massachusetts’ standard for furnaces in 2013 and furnace fans will be preempted in 2017.

","CA Executive Order B-18-12, signed in April of 2012, established targets for energy and water efficiency, as well as GHG emissions and rescinded a previous CA Executive Order S-20-04. Energy and water use reduction from baselines increased again in 2016. Energy savings targets included reductions in grid-based energy purchases by 20% by 2018 using 2003 as a baseline. State buildings have already reduced energy use by 24.88% through 2017 since 2003, exceeding the 2018 target a year in advance, and water energy savings has already doubled the 2020 target reduction. EO B-18-12 established targets for 50% of newly constructed state buildings and major renovations started after 2020 to be zero net energy, and 100% by 2025, as well as 50% of existing square footage shall include measures achieving zero net energy by 2025. However, in October 2017, a new policy went in to effect in the State Administrative Manual (SAM) section 1815.31, moving up the start date for 100% of new state buildings, major renovations, and build-to-suit leases beginning design after October 23, 2017, to be designed, constructed, and verified to be zero net energy (ZNE). This effectively moved up the start date for these ZNE new buildings by eight years. 50% of existing square footage shall include measures achieving zero net energy by 2025. 26 ZNE state buildings are verified already (~4.8 million square feet), 2 more are in their 12-month verification phase, and another 13 are in design or construction that will achieve ZNE (another 1.7 million square feet). A ZNE webpage includes policies, energy efficiency targets, tools (including a ZNE calculator), and resources to help state buildings achieve ZNE. The state facility website www.greenbuildings.ca.gov can now search individual facility data under each state department.

In 2016, the governor approved a definition for ZNE for existing and newly constructed state buildings, which closely aligns with the definition DOE published in 2015. In October 2017, state policy for meeting the Governor's Executive Order was published in California's State Administrative Manual (SAM), section 1815.31, outlining requirements, strategies, and resources to help state facilities achieve ZNE. It also established a new start date for state buildings beginning design after October 23, 2017, to be ZNE, including new buildings, major renovations, and build-to-suit leases. This can be viewed here. Additionally, energy efficiency targets were established for 50% of existing state buildings required to achieve ZNE by 2025 (see this document). These targets were established by 27 building types and occupancies prevalent in state use, and translated into 16 California climate zones. They reflect top quartile (25%) efficiency levels for each building/occupancy type, based on historical state building energy benchmarking. A ZNE calculator was developed to assist state agencies with calculating compliance and estimating renewable energy generation requirements.

New and existing buildings are required to incorporate building commissioning. Additionally, newly constructed buildings or major renovations smaller than 10,000 square feet must comply with the California Green Building Standards Tier I (15% more efficient than the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards), and larger than 10,000 square feet must comply with the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards plus earn the ""Silver"" level of LEED certification and incorporate on-site renewable energy if economically feasible. State agencies have installed over 43 MW of onsite renewable power generation at state facilities and more is planned or under construction. The University of California has installed an additional 36 MW of onsite renewable power and has more projects planned or under construction. Executive Branch facilities have many other installations underway and are well on track to reach 100MW goal by 2020. State facility energy, water, and GHG data are publicly displayed on website: www.greenbuildings.ca.gov.     

The Green Building Action Plan for EO B-18-12 further requires existing State buildings over 50,000 square feet to complete LEED-EB certification by December 31, 2015, to the extent it’s cost effective. Already, 231 new, existing, and leased executive branch state buildings (over 22 million square feet) have achieved LEED certification. Additionally, the University of California has more than 250 LEED certifications for its buildings, covering over 25 million square feet. State facilities were ordered to reduce water use by 10% by 2015, and 20% by 2020, from a 2010 baseline. State agencies have already reduced water use by 7.6 billion gallons annually, or 40% since 2010. Both energy and water use for all state facilities are benchmarked annually into the Energy Star Portfolio Manager. State agency energy use, water use, and GHG emissions are posted on the Governor’s public Green Building Website, and beginning in 2016 included individual facility data that is updated weekly. The Department of General Services working with State agencies has developed policies and guidelines for the sustainable operations and practices of State buildings to achieve operating efficiency improvements and water and resource conservation.

Executive Order B-2-11, issued January 28, 2011, requires an extensive analysis be conducted to eliminate all non-essential and cost-inefficient state fleet vehicles and equipment. The resulting right-sizing contributed to reduced petroleum use by the state fleet, particularly since the reduction was conducted to eliminate the most fuel inefficient vehicles.      

Executive Order B-16-12, issued March 23, 2012, requires California's state vehicle fleet to increase the number of its zero-emission vehicles through the normal course of fleet replacement so that at least 10 percent of light-duty fleet purchases are zero-emission by 2015 and at least 25 percent are zero-emission by 2020. Through this action, the state government’s fleet will be leading the way to the Executive Order’s goal of more than 1.5 million ZEVs in California by 2025, which will annually displace at least 1.5 billion gallons of petroleum fuels.

As required by the 2016 ZEV Action Plan, issued October 2016, California's state vehicle fleet is expanding upon Executive Order B-16-12’s zero-emission vehicle purchasing mandate and will ensure that through the normal course of fleet replacement at least 50 percent of light-duty fleet purchases are zero-emission by 2025. Management Memo 16-07 (December 2016) provides direction to state agencies for implementing the Governor’s 2016 ZEV Action Plan requirements. UC voluntarily adopted parallel targets for fleet replacement and commuter ZEVs in its Sustainable Practices Policy. CSU is in the process of adopting parallel targets for fleet vehicle purchases as part of the State University Administrative manual.

	Management Memo 12-05 (May 2012) – reinforces the obligation for state departments to maximize their use of alternative fuels and reduces or displaces petroleum consumption for their fleets.
	Management Memo 12-06 (May 2012) – requires state agencies to request reconditioned, used, or remanufactured automotive parts, and re-refined or synthetic motor oil and lubricants, whenever practical and cost-beneficial as state vehicles are repaired. The use of these products can help protect the environment and reduce petroleum consumption compared to the use of new materials.
	Management Memo 12-03 (April 2012) – mandates solar reflective colors for most new vehicle purchases, which reduce air conditioning needs and related petroleum consumption
	Management Memo 08-04 (March 2008) – established a minimum average fuel economy standard for most fleet vehicles. Efforts are currently underway to update the established minimum average fuel economy standard to reflect the market availability of more fuel efficient vehicles.                                                         
Assembly Bill 236 (2007) added California Public Resources Code §25722.8 (a), establishing the goal of reducing or displacing the state fleet’s petroleum use by 10 percent by January 1, 2012, and by 20 percent by January 1, 2020, as compared to a 2003 baseline. As of January 1, 2017, the state fleet met the 20 percent petroleum reduction goal with a total petroleum reduction from the 2003 baseline of 22.3 percent. To date, the state fleet has reduced its petroleum consumption by at least 13-percent and is on its way to meeting the 2020 goal of a 20-percent overall reduction. Additional information about this achievement and other state fleet sustainability initiatives is available here.

Senate Bill 498 (2017) added California Public Resources Code §25724, establishing a statutory requirement for the Department of General Services to “ensure that at least 50 percent of the light-duty vehicles purchased for the state fleet each fiscal year are zero-emission vehicles.” This statute codifies the 50% requirement issued in the Governor’s 2016 ZEV Action Plan and will further drive the state fleet towards our goal to reduce fleet related petroleum consumption and emissions.

Assembly Bill 739 (2017) added California Public Resources Code §25722.11, which requires, beginning December 31, 2025, that at least 15% of newly purchased vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 19,000 pounds or more purchased by state entities be zero emission. The statute also increases the purchasing requirement to 30% in December, 2030.

Of this amount, $60 million will be used to establish the Food Production Investment Program (FPIP), which will provide grants, loans, or financial incentives to food processors to implement projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. FPIP has two primary goals, (1) help replace high energy consuming equipment and systems in the food processing industry with market-ready and advanced technologies and equipment, and (2) accelerate the adoption of state-of-the-art energy technologies that can substantially reduce energy use and costs and the associated GHG emissions.

",7.5 out of 8,"California first adopted Building Energy Efficiency Standards in 1978, and has regularly updated them approximately every three years. California’s energy code is considered to be one of the most aggressive and best enforced energy code in the United States, and has been a powerful vehicle for advancing energy-efficiency standards for building components and equipment. The Standards are required by statute to be performance-based, offering flexibility for builders and designers. The code also stands out because it includes field verification (residential) and acceptance testing (nonresidential) requirements for certain measures that are prone to construction defects or improper commissioning, and because high compliance rates overall are reported for requirements for newly constructed buildings. California is working toward the goal of achieving zero net energy in the 2020 Standards for residential buildings and 2030 Standards for nonresidential buildings.  
","The 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards were adopted in June 2015, effective January 1, 2017 In June 2017 the California Energy Commission certified to U.S. DOE that the 2016 Standards exceed IECC 2015 by 29% on average for the residential building types analyzed (see Energy Commission Residential Energy Efficiency Comparison).  The 2016 Reach Standards, published in the California Green Building Standards (CALGreen), were adopted in October 2015, effective January 1, 2017, and establish standards for Energy Design Ratings that are 15% (Tier I) and 30% (Tier II) beyond the mandatory standards, as well as a Zero Net Energy Design designation, which local governments consider for adoption as local ordinances.

In May 2018, the CEC adopted the 2019 Building Energy Efficiency Standards, which take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, and are the first in the nation to require solar. The codes focus on four key areas: smart residential photovoltaic systems, updated thermal envelope standards, residential and nonresidential ventilation requirements, and nonresidential lighting requirements. Compared to the 2016 Standards, the 2019 Standards save 79% of electricity, 17% of demand, and 9% of natural gas for single-family buildings, and 53% on an energy cost basis.

","The 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards were adopted in June 2015, effective January 1, 2017.  In September 2016 the California Energy Commission certified to U.S. DOE that the 2016 Standards exceed ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2013 by 13% on average for the nonresidential building types analyzed (see Energy Commission Nonresidential Energy Efficiency Comparison). The 2016 Reach Standards were adopted in October 2015, effective January 1, 2017.  They establish updated Tier I and Tier II standards that local governments consider for adoption as local ordinances.

","Gap Analysis/Strategic Compliance Plan: The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), in collaboration with the Energy Commission, adopted the state’s Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan (“Strategic Plan”), presenting a single roadmap to achieve maximum energy savings across all major groups and sectors in California. This comprehensive Strategic Plan for 2009 to 2020 represents the state’s first integrated framework of goals and strategies for saving energy, covering government, utility, and private sector actions, and holds energy efficiency to its role as the highest priority resource in meeting California’s energy needs. The Strategic Plan established the Big Bold Energy Efficiency Strategies (BBEES), which call for all newly constructed residential buildings to be Zero Net Energy by 2020 and all newly constructed Commercial buildings by 2030. The Codes and Standards Action Plan and Zero Net Energy Action Plan add detail to the Strategic Plan.  In addition, the CPUC/IOUs on an ongoing basis conduct EM&V studies to investigate ways to improve compliance with the Standards. The IOU Compliance Enhancement Program developed a Best Practices report in 2012based on a gap analysis of seven building departments.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: The CPUC completed evaluations of building energy code compliance for the 2006-2008 program cycle in 2010 and for the 2010-2012 cycle in 2014. Reports can be found on the CALMAC website (http://www.calmac.org/).
	In October 2014 the CPUC completed the “Statewide Codes and Standards Program Impact Evaluation Report For Program Years 2010-2012.” In April 2015 BayREN completed the “BayREN Codes and Standards, Permit Resource Opportunity Program - PROP Final Report and Energy Code Resource Guide.” In January 2017 the CPUC completed the “Codes and Standards Compliance Improvement Program Years 2013-14 Process Evaluation.” The CPUC completed the 2013-2015 Impact Evaluation. The “California Statewide Codes and Standards Program Impact Evaluation Report Volume Two: T-24 Building Standards,” which assessed compliance with the 2013 Building Energy Efficiency Standards, was published in June 2017.
	
	Utility Involvement: California codes are supported by IOU incentive and rebate programs. Besides utility incentive programs, they develop and deliver building energy code training to a variety of stakeholders including builders, building departments, trades people, engineers, and architects in support of increase compliance. Regulatory guidelines have been established in Public Resources Code §25402.7 requiring significant utility involvement in supporting building energy code compliance. The CPUC has authorized the IOUs to support standards development since the early 2000s. Since 2008, the CPUC has authorized the IOUs to claim savings from standards development activities and to specifically develop and implement actions to support compliance improvement and standards implementation.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: The Energy Commission participates with several collaborative stakeholder groups and organizations that focus on improving code compliance throughout the state. These groups include the Compliance Improvement Advisory Group, the Western HVAC Performance Alliance Compliance Committee, the Bay Area Regional Energy Network Codes and Standards Program. In addition, the Commission participates with the California Building Officials (CALBO) statewide professional organization, with the County Building Officials Association of California (CBOAC) statewide professional organization, and with International Code Council (ICC) regional chapters around the state. BayREN is the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Energy Network that was established by Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG). BayREN is composed of county-level public agencies representing ABAG’s nine-county region and half the population of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company service territory. BayREN has chosen to focus efforts on Building Standards compliance improvement throughout their region. In 2014, BayREN initiated the 2014 Permit Resource Opportunity Program (PROP) to engage the scores of Building Departments in their territory to understand and develop approaches to address building department specific and region-wide barriers to Standards implementation.
	Training/Outreach: The Energy Commission conducts extensive outreach and education for the Building Energy Efficiency Standards to assist local building departments in enforcing and the industry in complying with the Standards. Such efforts include: developing and providing in-person training at California Building Official (CALBO) education events, International Code Council (ICC) chapter meetings, County Building Officials Association of California (CBOAC) annual events, California Association of Building Energy Consultants (CABEC) annual events, American Institute of Architects (AIA) chapter meetings, International Association of Electrical Inspectors (IAEI) meetings, Associated Lighting Representatives (ALR) meetings, and the Institute of Heating and Air Conditioning Industries (IHACI) annual events.
	The Energy Commission also updated, developed, and published numerous resources to help facilitate compliance and enforcement with the 2016 Energy Code, including: energy videos, fact sheets, quick references, guides, counter cards, and presentations. All of these resources are located on the Energy Commission’s Online Resource Center.
		New efforts on behalf of the Energy Commission for this past year included: becoming a fully functional International Code Council (ICC) Preferred Provider (PP) with approved courses and issuing continuing education unit (CEUs) certificates for training provided under the ICC PP program; reaching out to and attending meetings, outreach, and education events, and providing training for industry groups such as the Local Building Officials (LBO), Building Owners and Managers Association International (BOMA), and the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI).
		Under the Energy Code Ace brand, the California IOUs’ Compliance Improvement Program provides online tools and training to market actors throughout the Building Energy Efficiency Standards compliance industry. Targeted market actors include: plans examiners and building inspectors, energy consultants, architects and designers, lighting designers and installers, HVAC contractors, and appliance manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. Energy Code Ace strives to provide online tools and training when and where the compliance industry needs it. In 2017, Energy Code Ace launched the new Code & Coffee live stream series and created a new learning block series in support of Certified Energy Analysts. The team also focused on developing dynamic, digital tools that automate the compliance process in close collaboration with the CEC. In addition to the new, dynamic focus that can be found on the CEC’s website, new resources and training were added to the Energy Code Ace library, such as the “Lighting Wheel” and new online self-studies that are designed to teach people how to use the new forms.
	
	The Energy Commission, IOUs and other stakeholders conduct ongoing training and outreach throughout the state.  In combination, these collaborating organizations each year provide hundreds of in-person training sessions on Standards requirements and compliance options, compliance software, building department plan review and site inspection, and HERS rater field verification to increase compliance and enforcement with the Standards.  The IOUs also developed online courses that are available at any day and time of the year. These efforts included: developing and providing in-person training at CALBO Education Events, ICC Chapter Meetings, AIA Chapter Meetings; Institute of Heating and Air Conditioning Industries; attending events on a monthly basis to provide CEC updates; developing tools and resources to help simplify compliance and enforcement of the Energy Standards; and providing technical support to utilities' Energy Code Ace by reviewing their Energy Standards tools/resources and promoting utility funded training on the Energy Standards. The Energy Commission's budget for building code compliance, enforcement, and training and outreach was $3.2 million. The IOU and BayREN authorized budget was approximately $6 million.

",3 out of 3,"California has implemented a variety of policies to encourage CHP including interconnection standards, incentive programs, financial assistance, and additional supportive policies. In 2018, five new CHP installations were completed.
","Policy: Rule 21

Description: California was among the first states to establish a standard interconnection policy for distributed generation. Approved in 2000, Rule 21 applies to CHP and other DG systems up to 10 MW. It has been adopted as a model by all three major investor-owned utilities and follows the established technical guidelines of the IEEE 1547 interconnection standard.

In September 2012, the California Public Utilities Commission enacted several major changes to Rule 21 for the first time since 2000. Changes include a ""fast track"" application process for systems that meet certain size standards, as well as several detailed study options for larger facilities.

Last Updated: July 2018
","CHP in energy efficiency standards: There is currently no portfolio standard in place under which CHP is eligible, but two state policies set targets for CHP deployment in California. One is Assembly Bill 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which calls for 4,000 megawatts (MW) of new CHP resources to result in 6.7 million metric tons (MMT) of greenhouse gas reductions. This policy was expanded through the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2016. The second is the Governor’s Clean Energy Jobs Program, which calls for the addition of 6,500 MW of CHP by 2030.

Under Assembly Bill 1890 (1996) and Assembly Bill 995 (2000), California established a ""loading order"" that calls for first pursuing all cost-effective efficiency resources to meet new load. The CPUC considers CHP a key element of this loading order, which is a guiding principle that specifies the state's general preference to pursue opportunities for energy efficiency and renewable generation before constructing new fossil fueled generation resources.

CHP programs:  The state and investor-owned utilities are running several programs designed to acquire cost-effective CHP energy resources. The Qualifying Facilities and CHP Program Settlement is the primary mechanism to require electric utilities to acquire new, efficient CHP resources. A technology incentive is also available through the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), which provides incentive payments to support the commercialization of new, efficient CHP technologies, among other eligible technologies.

Production Goal: The Qualifying Facilities and CHP Program Settlement established a mandatory requirement for California's three large electric utilities to procure a minimum of 3,000 MW of CHP by 2015 and sufficient capacity and energy from efficient CHP facilities to acheive 2.72 MMTCO2e of emissions reductions by 2020. The program was recently updated in a long-term procurement planning decision (D.15-06-028), which reduced previous procurement targets and required the electric utilities to hold solicitations between 2015 and 2020 to procure energy and capacity from efficient CHP resources sufficient to achieve 2.72 MMTCO2e of greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

Revenue streams: CHP systems in California have access to a feed-in tariff (FIT), which establishes a price paid and approved standard offer contracts for the purchase of excess electricity from eligible CHP generators.  Public Utilities Code 2840 directs the CPUC, the California Energy Commission, and the Air Resources Board to implement the Waste Heat and Carbon Emissions Reduction Act, which required the CPUC to establish a feed-in tariff for CHP systems that are smaller than 20 MW, in operation after January 1, 2008, and highly efficient (operating above a 62% total efficiency). The Measurement and Verification requirements were updated in 2016 to reduce deployment barriers. 

Additionally, the California Public Utilities Commission’s implementation of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 provides CHP facilities that have a capacity of less than or equal to 20 MW and that have federal qualifying facility certification with an opportunity to execute a standard offer contract. This contract provides energy payments at the utility’s short run avoided cost and administratively-set capacity payments.

Last Updated: July 2018
","Incentives, grants, or financing: CHP systems may have access to grants and loans through the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), which provides incentives to customers who produce electricity from a variety of sources. Beginning in 2017, all gas generation projects within the SGIP program must blend a minimum of renewable fuel with the gas fueling the SGIP project. In 2019 that amount must be at least 50% of the total fuel input, rising each year to 100% in 2020. 15% of the program's budget is avaialable for CHP. This program is thus much less supportive of traditional natural gas-fueled CHP than previously, and will impact a smaller portion of the CHP market, namely, those potential projects that are located near an affordable source of high quality biogas, since pipeline-grade renewable biogas is currently more expensive than regular natural gas.

Net metering: Under California's net energy metering (NEM) tariff, participating customers receive a bill credit for excess generation that is exported to the electric grid. On a month-to-month basis, bill credits for excess generation are applied to a customer's bill at the retail rate. At the end of a customer's 12-month billing period, any balance of surplus electricity is trued-up at a separate fair market value, known as net surplus compensation (NSC), which is based on a 12-month rolling average of the market for energy.

As of July 1, 2017, each investor-owned utility (IOU) offers a NEM successsor tarriff that was adopted by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in 2016 (AB 327, 2013). The tarriff makes adjustments to align the costs of NEM successor customers more closely with those of non-NEM customers. Among the new elements to NEM made by the decision is a requirement that NEM successor customers must pay non-bypassable charges on each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity they consume from the grid. Customer-sited CHP facilities are eligible for both NEM tariffs if they are fueled by eligible renewable fuels.

Following passage of AB-1613 in 2007, a feed-in tariff (F-I-T) was established for CHP systems no larger than 20 MW that met specified emissions and efficiency criteria. Seven facilities totaling 45 MW of nameplate capacity received or pursued such contracts.

Last Updated: August 2019
","California provides CHP-focused technical assistance through the Center for Sustainable Energy and through the California Energy Commission, which provides information on air permitting, demand response with CHP, financial incentives for CHP projects, and other issues. California also provides technical assistance through the investor-owned electric utilities, which assist CHP facilities in meeting the eligibility and interconnection requirements of the standard offer contracts available through the state's CHP feed-in-tarrif and the state's implementation of PURPA.

The CA IOUs frequently issue Requests for Offers (RFOs) for Local Capacity Resources (LCRs). Most of these RFOs are targeted specifically at renewable Distributed Generation (DG) and/or energy storage resources. Some RFOs are open to qualified natural gas CHP, albeit without the preference points given to renewable resources. For example, a 2015 CPUC decision allows Southern California Gas Company to provide Distributed Energy Resources (DERS) Tariff, which offers customers a fully elective, optional tariff under which SoCalGas would design, own and maintain CHP facilities on a customer's premise and charge the customer market-based prices for the service. 

The state also has policies to encourage the use of renewable-fueled CHP systems. In addition to offering incentives through the SGIP that are higher for projects powered with renewable fuels, the CPUC also began administering a bioenergy feed-in tariff in 2014, for which bioenergy projects are eligible. State Law SB 859 requires electricity retailers to collectively procure a total of 125 MW of energy from dead/dying trees.

California launched the BioMAT Program in 2015 for bioenergy generators less than 5 MW in size. A total of 250 MWs were made available to eligible projects through fixed price standard contracts to export electricity to one of CA’s three IOUs. Heat utilization is optional, and CHP can enhance the economics when a suitable thermal host is on site or nearby. Through 2018, there have been 22 signed contracts for 33 MW of capacity statewide.

Escalation of wildfires in the State have heightened attention on grid resiliency. PG&E, which has been hardest hit by the fires, is implementing a pre-emptive de-energization program and is planning for strategic “Resiliency Zones” with local power capability. Thus far, the plans for these Zones have included capability for grid isolated operation, hardening of transmission and distribution lines, and interconnection hookups for mobile generation sources. However, CHP has not been receiving much attention.

",15.5 out of 20,"California is a long-time leading state for its utility-sector customer energy efficiency programs, which date back to the 1970s and have grown and evolved substantially over four decades. Investor-owned utilities administer energy efficiency programs with oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which establishes key policies and guidelines, sets program goals, and approves spending levels. California's publicly-owned utilities (POUs) also administer customer programs. All of the investor-owned electric and gas utilities in California have decoupling, which has been in place for many years and is an integral part of California's ""big, bold"" energy efficiency initiative. Utilities may also earn performance incentives for energy efficiency efforts. 

In October 2015, California enacted SB 350, calling on state agencies and utilities to work together to double cumulative efficiency savings by 2030. California’s current targets are embedded in the approved 2016-2024 program portfolios and budgets for the state’s IOUs, which calls for incremental electricity savings of about 1.15% over the period (see CPUC Decision 15-10-028).

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Investor-owned utilities administer energy efficiency programs with oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which establishes key policies and guidelines, sets program goals, and approves spending levels. Investor-owned utilities and third-party contractors implement the programs. A share of public benefits funding is designated to go to non-utility organizations to offer programs that supplement and complement those of the IOUs and POUs. California's publicly-owned utilities (POUs), such as large municipal utilities serving Los Angeles and Sacramento, also administer and provide programs to their customers.

Several utilities provide on-bill financing. More information may be found in the ACEEE report, Energy Efficiency Financing Programs.

California's utilities fund some of their programs and initiatives through resource procurement budgets and recover their costs through rate cases brought before the CPUC. California's utilities also used to collect a Public Goods Charge (PGC) on customer utility bills to fund utility energy efficiency programs. Public Goods Charge is California’s name for a public benefits fund established in Assembly Bill 1890 in 1996. The PGC (see R.09-09-047, section 11) was not reauthorized by the California Legislature in 2011, and Governor Brown directed the CPUC to pursue continuation of funding for these programs before the PGC expires. About one-quarter of the utility energy efficiency portfolio budgets came through the PGC; the remaining majority of the energy efficiency portfolios is funded through utility procurement funds and is unaffected by the expiration of the PGC.

California also funds energy efficiency programs through funds collected as part of its AB 32 cap and trade program. AB 32 requires California to reduce its GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 — a reduction of approximately 15 percent below emissions expected under a “business as usual” scenario. AB 32 authorizes the collection of a fee from sources of GHGs, including oil refineries, electricity power plants (including imported electricity), cement plants, and food processors. Funds collected are used to provide staffing, contracts, and equipment to the Air Resources Board (ARB) and other state agencies to implement AB 32. 

Beginning in fiscal year 2013-2014, California has particularly targeted energy efficiency improvements in schools. The California Clean Energy Jobs Act (Prop. 39) changed the corporate income tax code and allocated projected revenue to California's General Fund and the Clean Energy Job Creation Fund for five fiscal years. Under the initiative, roughly $550 million annually is available for appropriation by the Legislature for eligible projects to improve energy efficiency and expand clean energy generation in schools.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","California has established energy efficiency as its highest priority energy resource for procurement of new resources. Under Assembly Bill 1890 (1996) and Assembly Bill 995 (2000), California has established a “loading order” that calls for first pursuing all cost-effective efficiency resources, then using cost-effective renewable resources, and only after that using conventional energy sources to meet new load.  As authorized under California Public Utility Code § 454.55-56, the CPUC has established aggressive targets and associated funding for energy efficiency programs.

In Decision 12-11-015 the CPUC directed IOUs, regional energy networks, and community choice aggregators to apply a market spillover effects adder of 5% to their program tracking claims, acknowledging the impacts of energy efficiency programs on the market overall. 

California has effectively doubled its energy efficiency goals as a result of SB 350, passed in October 2015. This bill requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to establish annual targets for statewide energy efficiency savings and demand reduction that will achieve a cumulative doubling of statewide energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas final end uses of retail customers by January 1, 2030. 

Decision 15-10-028 adopted 2016 goals of 2,864 GWh/yr electricity savings and 50.7 MMT/year in natural gas savings. Compared to the goals adopted in the previous year's D.14-10-046, gigawatt hours (GWh) goals are 10% higher, megawatt (MW) goals are 20% higher, and gas goals are 12% lower.

","Summary: Electric: Incremental savings targets average about 1.3% of retail sales from 2020-2025. Natural Gas: Incremental savings target of ~0.87% from 2020-2025.

Following California’s 2001 electricity crisis, the main state resource agencies worked together along with the state’s utilities and other key stakeholders and developed the California Integrated Energy Policy Report that included energy savings goals for the state’s IOUs. The CPUC formalized the goals in Decision 04-09-060 in September 2004. The goals called for electricity use reductions in 2013 of 23 billion kWh and peak demand reductions of 4.9 million kW from programs operated over the 2004–2013 period. The natural gas goals were set at 67 MMTh per year by 2013.

The California Legislature emphasized the importance of energy efficiency and established broad goals with the enactment of Assembly Bill 2021 of 2006. The bill requires the California Energy Commission (CEC), the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and other interested parties to develop efficiency savings and demand reduction targets for the next 10 years. Having already developed interim efficiency goals for each of the IOUs from 2004 through 2013, the CPUC developed new electric and natural gas goals in 2008 for years 2012 through 2020, which call for 16,300 GWh of gross electric savings over the 9-year period (see CPUC Decision 08-07-047). See Decision 09-09-04 for 2010-2012 energy efficiency portfolios and Decision 14-10-046 for 2015 goals.

California’s current targets are embedded in the approved 2016-2024 program portfolios and budgets for the state’s IOUs, which called for incremental electricity savings averaging about 1.15% over the period (see CPUC Decision 15-10-028)

In 2015, California essentially doubled its energy efficiency goals by passing SB 350.  This bill requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to establish annual targets for statewide energy efficiency savings and demand reduction that will achieve a cumulative doubling of statewide energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas final end uses of retail customers by January 1, 2030. The bill would require the PUC to establish efficiency targets for electric and gas corporations consistent with this goal. It would also require local publicly-owned electric utilities to establish annual targets for energy efficiency savings and demand reduction consistent with this goal. The CEC's SB 350 energy efficiency target-setting efforts are anticipated to be completed in late 2017. In May 2016, the CPUC reported initial estimates of the impact of SB350, available here. 

Additional efforts that will impact savings levels include recent all-source procurement RFOs that took place in Southern California. These resulted in 145 MW of procurement and are expected to come online between 2016 and 2022. The recent Diablo Canyon Power Plant retirement proposal includes replacement of some of the energy with energy efficiency. The first phase was approved in January 2018 for 2,000 GWh of savings that commence in the years 2019-2024.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

California’s Long Term Energy Efficiency Strategic Plan, first adopted in 2008 and updated in 2011, establishes a goal for the Commission's Energy Savings Assistance Program that, by 2020, 100% of eligible and willing customers will have received all cost-effective low-income energy efficiency measures.

The Commission’s Energy Savings Assistance Program installs weatherization and energy efficiency measures, provides minor home repairs, and offers energy education at no cost to income-eligible program participants. Income eligibility for the Energy Savings Assistance Program is set at 200% or less of the Federal Poverty Guideline. The program is funded by ratepayers as part of a statutory public purpose program surcharge that appears on monthly utility bills, with the goal to reduce energy consumption, resulting in bill savings, while also increasing the health, comfort, and/or safety of the household.

Public Utility Code Section 2790 requires an electrical or gas corporation to perform home weatherization services for low-income customers. A utility must balance the cost effectiveness of the weatherization services and the policy of reducing the hardships low-income households face. It is set in code that by 2020, 100% of all eligible and willing low-income customers will be given the opportunity to participate in the program. An ongoing aspiration for the program is that it will be an energy resource by delivering increasingly cost-effective and longer-term savings to participants. For each budget cycle, the CPUC establishes program funding, energy savings targets, and household treatment/participation goals for each utility through a Decision.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Currently California applies the Energy Savings Assistance Program Cost Effectiveness test (ESACET) and the Resource Total Resource Cost test to the low-income program. These tests incorporate non-energy benefits and are related to the social goal of providing equitable demand-side management (DSM) treatment to the portion of the California housing stock in which low-income customers reside.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with the California Department of Community Services & Development's Low-Income Programs

The California Department of Community Services & Development (CSD) administers the Low?Income Weatherization Program (LIWP), which installs solar photovoltaics, solar hot water heaters, and energy efficiency measures in low?income single family and multi?family dwellings in low-income communities to reduce GHG emissions and save energy. LIWP is funded through AB 32 cap-and-trade auction revenues and was allocated a total of $154 million in the 2014–15 and 2015–16 state budgets. Decision 16-11-022 directed the large investor-owned utilities to work with the Community Services and Development’s low-income weatherization programs on various fronts, including setting up a data sharing plan and establishing a referral process between the ESA Program and CSD’s program for identified customers with high energy burden and non?IOU fuel sources.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with SB350

SB 350 was passed in 2015 establishing annual savings targets to achieve a cumulative doubling of statewide energy efficiency savings by 2030. The bill mentions no specific low-income energy efficiency targets, but it does direct the California Energy Commission to publish a study on barriers for low-income customers to energy efficiency and weatherization investments, including those in disadvantaged communities, as well as recommendations on how to increase access to energy efficiency and weatherization investments for low-income customers.

","California initially implemented decoupling through the Supply Adjustment Mechanism (SAM) for gas utilities beginning in 1978 (Decision 88835). By 1982, similar mechanisms were in place for the three electric IOUs. As the gas industry restructured, gas utilities began to serve large customers under a straight fixed-variable rate design, which continues through today. The CPUC stopped the electric decoupling mechanisms in 1996 due to restructuring of the electric power industry. 

In 2001, the Legislature passed Section 739.10, which required that the CPUC resume decoupling. Decoupling resumed for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric beginning with the 2004 revenue requirement. Currently, the revenue decoupling program is combined with performance incentives for meeting or exceeding energy efficiency targets. Revenue requirements are adjusted for customer growth, productivity, weather, and inflation on an annual basis with rate cases every three or four years, varying by utility.

Decoupling mechanisms have been developed and applied in individual cases with the IOUs. All of the investor-owned electric and gas utilities have decoupling, which has been in place for many years and is an integral policy for California's ""big, bold"" energy efficiency initiative (CA Code Sec. 9 Section 739(3) and Sec. 10 Section 739.10 as amended by A.B. XI 29; Decisions 98-03-063 & 07-09-043).

The California Public Utilities Commission defined a new Energy Savings and Performance Incentive (ESPI) for investor-owned utilities in Rulemaking 12-01-005. Decision 13-09-023 (September 2013) allocates incentive earnings among four major categories: Energy Efficiency Resource Savings; Ex Ante Review Process Performance; Codes and Standards Advocacy Programs; and Non-Resource Program: 

Incentives for energy efficiency resource savings are capped at 9% of resource program expenditures.
	Incentives for successful implementation of ex ante ""lock down"" are based on performance scores and are paid as an award of up to 3% of resource program expenditures.
	Incentives are also provided for utility involvement in codes and standards programs in the form of a management fee equal to 12% of approved program expenditures.
	For non-resource programs, utilities may earn a management fee equal to 3% of non-resource program expenditures (exclusive of administrative costs).
D.13.09.023 directs Commission staff to identify deemed measures with sufficiently uncertain ex ante savings parameters such that the savings claim should be subject to ex post verification in order to be included in the incentive payment. For the purposes of the ESPI mechanism, ""sufficiently uncertain"" measures are defined as those measures for which the Commission believes the net lifetime savings of the current DEER or non-DEER savings estimate may be as much as 50% or more under- or over-estimated.

","Guidelines for Third Party Access

In May 2014, the Commission approved Decision (D.) 14-05-016, adopting rules to provide eligible third-party access to energy usage and usage-related data within IOU territories. The decision directed the CA IOUs to establish the Energy Data Request and Release Process (EDRP), which is underway, as well as an Energy Data Access Committee comprised of relevant stakeholders to serve as an informal advisory body. 

Data to third parties are transmitted via utilities’ Green Button Connect platforms. Depending on the use case, data may be transmitted in various levels of aggregation via FTP sites, CSV download, or in other formats as requested by parties.

Eligibility to receive aggregated energy usage data is restricted to academic researchers, local government departments, and their consultants, State Agencies. Use cases involving requests for commercial purposes, including market research for commercial energy services, are not eligible. Eligibility for accessing aggregated customer energy usage data is based on the use cases of the requesting party, which are detailed in D.14-05-016. The EDRP process includes utility requirements for verifying requesting parties, who are also required to sign an NDA with the utility or adhere to the utility’s Terms and Conditions. 

For third party access to customer-specific data, utilities require third parties to register with their Green Button Connect platform, and third party users are required to complete an IT test prior to connecting to utility data. Third party data access requires certain IT specifications, such as security and assurance that the third party system can provide the SSL certificate to connect to a utility’s data system.

Data requests and responses are made using secure HTTPS protocol and are authenticated via a two-way certificate exchange with the utility. Requesters need to implement security certificates for secure inbound and outbound API communication.

California investor-owned utilities do not charge a fee for providing data. Costs incurred by utilities for data management and request fulfilment are tracked in a balancing account and funded through general rate cases.

Data provided via Green Button Connect platforms contain both usage and billing information for 12 months of customer usage, either hourly or at 15-minute intervals.

Requirements for Provision of Energy Use Data

Decision (D.) 14-05-016 creates a process whereby entities can request energy usage and usage-related data from utilities and receive action on the request and resolution of disputes over access to data.

AB 1103 (Cal. Pub. Res. Code 25402.10(b)) requires utilities to deliver Whole Building Usage Information (WBUI) to building owners for nonresidential buildings covered by the Act “in a manner that preserves the confidentiality of the customer.” Currently, WBUI provision has been interpreted by the IOUs to exclude buildings with fewer than 15 tenants. Building owners must still acquire permission from tenants to access whole building information via Green Button Connect.

D.13-09-025 authorizes the provision of customer energy data to third parties upon customer request via Customer Data Access or Green Button Connect.

D. 14-05-016 also directs utilities, after informing the Commission, to provide energy data to state and federal government entities that need data to fulfill statutory obligations and request such data pursuant to this decision. 

Pursuant to California’s landmark legislation, AB802, every utility in California is required, as of January 1, 2017, to provide a year's worth of monthly energy consumption for an entire building to an owner (or owner's agent) upon request, provided that building consists of three or more commercial utility accounts or five or more accounts, if any are residential. A utility has four weeks to respond to a request and provide the information directly to the owner or upload it to the owner's Energy Star Portfolio Manager account. Portfolio Manager is an EPA created online tool that enables owners to benchmark their properties in a secure online environment.

Energy Use Data Availability

The data request and release process enables IOUs to grant requests for aggregated usage data by university researchers, state and federal agencies, and local governments. 

The CPUC has directed each investor-owned utility to maintain a data request portal on their websites where Energy Data Request Process details for aggregated data can be found. D.14-05-016 describes the EDRP requirements for each use case, but all are bound by either NDA or Terms and Conditions to receive data. Formats vary depending on user preference. The utilities are required to notify the Executive Director four weeks prior to delivery of any new data sets to requesting parties. The utilities must also file quarterly advice letters with updates to the “data catalogs” that each utility is required to maintain. This information is detailed on the utility websites, which can be located from this web page: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=10151.

","Light-duty vehicles:

The 2002 passage of the Pavley Bill in California was the first time that a law in the United States addressed the issue of greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks. In 2004, California adopted a new set of vehicle emission standards to implement the Pavley law. The regulations require automakers to produce vehicles that will, on average, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 30% from 2002 levels by 2016. Increased efficiency through the use of improved vehicle technology is expected to be the primary method for obtaining these reductions. Several other states have adopted California’s emissions program. California’s vehicle emission standards were harmonized with the federal fuel economy and greenhouse gas programs upon the adoption of new, more stringent federal fuel economy standards in April 2010 for model years 2012-2016.

In 2012, the California Air Resources Board adopted new GHG standards for model years 2017 to 2025 calling for a fleet-wide average increase in stringency of between 4% and 5% per year over those years. In 2012, California also updated the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program that requires increasing production of plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and fuel-cell electric vehicles from 2018 to 2025.

In 2016, CARB jointly published a draft Technical Assessment Report (TAR) with the U.S. EPA and NHTSA, conveying an updated cost and technology feasibility for the current standards. In January 2017, the U.S. EPA and CARB released reports finalizing their reviews and concluded the current standards remain feasible. In April 2018, the U.S. EPA issued a revised Final Determination announcing their plans to re-open the national vehicle standards and California, along with 16 other states, have filed a lawsuit opposing that action.

Heavy-duty vehicles:

In 2008, California adopted new GHG regulations to reduce emissions through the fuel efficiency improvement of tractor-trailers. Between 2010 and 2020, tractor-trailers are subject to stringent fuel economy regulations.

In 2018, CARB adopted the Innovative Clean Transit Regulation, requiring all public transit agencies to gradually transition to a 100 percent zero-emission bus fleet. Recently, CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Regulation, which would require private and public airport shuttle fleet owners to transition their fleet to zero-emission shuttles. In addition, CARB developed the Advanced Clean Truck proposal to reduce GHG emissions by accelerating the first wave of zero-emission trucks and fostering a self-sustaining market. CARB is also in the process of developing proposals for a number of new measures that will further advance the commercialization of zero- and near zero?emission technologies. The Zero?Emission Powertrain Certification will support current and future advanced?technology measures applicable to medium?duty vehicles, heavy?duty vehicles, and off?road equipment. This will ensure that zero?emission technologies deployed are able to meet the reliability and performance expectations of California fleets.

","Transportation and Land Use Integration: California has identified smart growth and transportation system efficiency strategies as a major component of its plans to implement AB32, which requires a 25% reduction from 1990 levels in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. In 2008, California passed SB 375, requiring that the Air Resources Board (ARB), in consultation with the Metropolitan Planning Organizations, set regional goals for greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. Regional transportation plans will need to incorporate those targets, and Regional Housing Needs Assessments in turn will have to be aligned with the land use component of the transportation plans. SB 375 also relaxes the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process for housing projects that are consistent with plans to meet regional greenhouse gas reduction goals and ensures adequate inter-agency cooperation in the development of the regional plans.

VMT Targets: ARB adopted final targets, expressed as percent per capita changes in emissions for each region, in September, 2010. In March 2018, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) updated the SB 375 (2008) regional targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicle travel. Prior to that, as part of the 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan Update adopted in December 2017, CARB identified the need for an additional 15 percent reduction in total statewide light-duty vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in 2050. This also supports one of the three pillars announced by Governor Brown in 2015, to reduce petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent from today's levels. These reductions are envisioned to be achieved in part by implementation of updated SB 375 targets and regional Sustainable Communities Strategies; forthcoming statewide implementation of SB 743 (2013); and additional State VMT reduction strategies.

Complete Streets: California also adopted AB 1358 in 2008, a bill that mandates municipalities to create long-term plans that incorporate “complete streets” goals for the physical development of their respective communities. From January 2011 onwards, city or county legislative bodies must “plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways, defined to include motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial goods, and users of public transportation, in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.” A major objective of complete streets requirements is to expand the use of non-auto modes of transportation and thereby help to reduce vehicle miles traveled.

FAST Freight Plans and Goals: California has a freight plan that identifies a multimodal freight network and establishes an aggressive goal for the freight industry of near zero emissions status by 2050.

Description: California was the first state in the country to adopt appliance and equipment efficiency standards. The authority to adopt appliance and equipment efficiency standards was bestowed upon the California Energy Commission as stipulated under the Warren-Alquist Act, which was enacted in 1974. Over the years, California has adopted standards on more than 50 products, many of which have subsequently become federal standards. California has collaborated with other countries to set harmonized standards for products that have a worldwide market, beginning with external power supplies in 2007.  

On September 2, 2010, California's Office of Administrative Law approved the introduction of efficiency standards for televisions, making California the first state to adopt standards for televisions, effective 2011 with an updated standard becoming effective in 2013. In 2012 California adopted standards for battery chargers. In 2013 the Energy Commission began information collection and the “pre-rulemaking” phase of standards development for 15 categories of appliances. 

In April 2015, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-29-15, establishing the first ever statewide mandatory water reductions to address California’s ongoing drought. One week later the Energy Commission adopted by emergency it’s proposed standards to reduce the water use of faucets, toilets and urinals. 

In May 2015, the Energy Commission adopted efficiency standards for fluorescent dimming ballasts, labeling requirements for HVAC air filters,and test and list requirements for heat pump water-chilling packages, all of which take effect July 1, 2016. In September 2015, under the emergency Executive Order B-29-15, the Energy Commission adopted two-tiered standards for showerheads, and amended its standards for lavatory faucets. Finally, in January 2016, the Energy Commission adopted standards for general service LED lamps and small-diameter directional lamps, which will take effect beginning January 1, 2018. During 2015 and 2016, the Energy Commission conducted pre-rulemaking workshops on standards for computers, computer monitors, and signage displays, as well as for pool pump motors and portable electric spas.

In August 2015, the Energy Commission launched its Modernized Appliance Efficiency Database System, which allows manufacturers to certify their products online and which has greatly improved the efficiency and utility of the state certification process.""

In 2016, the Energy Commission adopted efficiency standards for computers, computer monitors, and signage display and conducted workshops for pool pumps and portable electric spas. In January 2017, the Energy Commission started Phase 2 of the appliance rulemaking as stated in the 2012 Order Instituting Rulemaking.  Appliances being considered for efficiency standards in Phase 2 include commercial and industrial fans and blowers, general service lamps, sprinkler spray bodies, tub-spout diverters, and irrigation controllers. 

In late 2018 and early 2019, the Energy Commission adopted standards for portable air conditioners, air compressors, and portable electric spas. 

 

Did the state adopt a provision to backstop light bulb standards in case of repeal or or rollback? Did the state adopt a provision to backstop all other federal standards in case of repeal or rollback?

Yes. In December 2008, California adopted a 45 lumen per watt standard for general service lamps (GSLs) as defined in the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). This standard had an effective date of January 1, 2018, and was contingent upon DOE’s failure to complete certain actions as directed by Congress through EISA. DOE failed to complete those actions and California implemented the 45 lumen per watt standard for GSLs manufactured on or after January 1, 2018. Additionally, the Energy Commission has an active proceeding (Docket 17-AAER-07) to consider expanding the scope of the existing GSL standard, in case of repeal or rollback of DOE’s January 19, 2017, definitions for GSLs. 
 California’s Title 20 Appliance Efficiency Regulations have long had existing provisions that backstop all other federal appliance standards in case of repeal or rollback (Title 20 section 1605(a)).

In partnership with the University of Rhode Island, RI Office of Energy Resources (OER) developed an energy data inventory that includes of electricity and natural gas consumption for 100% of state building square footage. The state is in the process of matching properties with energy data and is seeking proposals for a web-based utility bill management application to streamline reporting and tracking capabilities.

The state has also established the Rhode Island Public Energy Partnership (RIPEP), which is a 3-year (2012-2015), U.S. Department of Energy-funded collaborative effort to achieve deep energy savings in state and municipal facilities and build a sustained, effective infrastructure for ongoing savings. Led by the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, RIPEP brought together the Office of Energy Resources, National Grid, URI Outreach Center, Narragansett Bay Commission, Energy Efficiency and Management Council, and other key public and private sector representatives. The project completed in 2015 and achieved the following results:

	Implemented 123 energy efficiency projects for total energy savings of 28.6% or 4,748 MMBTU.
	Utilized over $5 million in rebates and on-bill repayment funds, including $2.5 million in RGGI funds, to support project implementation.
	Identified barriers to implementing energy efficiency in the public sector then addressed these barriers through master price agreements, expanded and enhancing financing and incentive options, and extensive technical assistance.
In addition to recent programs, The Green Buildings Act (November 9, 2010) requires that all major facility projects of public agencies be designed and constructed to at least the LEED certified or an equivalent high performance green building standard. Under the Green Buildings Act, the Department of Administration is responsible for monitoring and documenting ongoing operating savings that result from this Act and annually publish a public report of findings and recommended changes in policy. Additionally, the Act required the Department of Administration to create a green buildings advisory committee composed of representatives from the design, construction, lumber and building materials industries involved in public works contracting, personnel from affected public agencies and school boards that oversee public works projects and others at the department's discretion to provide advice on implementing this section.

",3 out of 3,"The state offers incentives for CHP deployment and includes CHP as an eligible resource within its energy efficiency resource standard. No new CHP systems came online in Rhode Island in 2018.
","In 2011, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed General Law 39-26.3 “Distribution Generation Interconnection,” with the stated finding that “expeditious completion of the application process for renewable distributed generation is in the public interest. In November 2011, the RI PUC adopted a tariff titled, “RIPUC #2078, Standards for Connected Distributed Generation,” for which CHP is eligible. The tariff is for renewable interconnecting customers as well as interconnecting customers, and, therefore, covers all forms of fuel. Additionally, the tariff applies to systems greater than 10 MW. 

Under tariff #2078, National Grid offers a three-tiered (Simplified, Standard, and Expedited) interconnection processes for distributed generation, including CHP. A project's review path is determined by project characteristics including generation type, size, customer load, and the characteristics of the grid where the system is to be located. Maximum total review days depend on review type, ranging from 15 days for a Simplified Review to 120-150 for a Standard review (usually complex projects). These standards were cited as supportive policies in the 2015 Energy Efficiency Program Plan which was approved by the Rhode Island PUC. 

Last Updated: August 2019
","CHP in energy efficiency standards: Rhode Island established an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard in 2006 requiring regulated utilities to submit three-year energy efficiency resource plans, which explicitly include CHP as an eligible resource. Legislation passed in June 2012 (H.B. 8233) requires utilities to support the installation of efficient CHP systems; each utility must specify in its annual efficiency program and how it will do so.

CHP programs: In 2012, Rhode Island's Least Cost Procurement statute was amended to include a new CHP provision to encourage the consideration of its additional benefits. See R.I.G.L. § 39-1-27.7(c)(6)(ii) through (iv). Today, National Grid Electric implements a CHP Program that is designed to acquire cost-effective CHP energy resources (like other efficiency resources). All of Rhode Island is served by National Grid and the utility provides eligible CHP projects with a combination of energy efficiency, performance rebates, and advanced gas technology incentives. The total incentive package cannot exceed 70% of total project cost and is subject to budgetary limitations and caps.

Production goal: For 2018, National Grid is proposing a target of 1 MW of installed capacity that is expected to correspond to approximately 8,000 MWh of savings. Additionally, for 2018, National Grid has set a goal of three installations in Rhode Island and a commitment to initiate at least two additional projects in future years.

Revenue Streams: CHP systems have access to production incentives through National Grid's CHP Program. For any project greater than 1 new MW, a performance-based energy efficiency incentive, capped at $20/kW-year ($1.66/kW-month) for a period of up to ten years, is available.

Last Updated: August 2019
","Incentives, grants, or financing:  National Grid’s CHP Program provides capacity incentives ranging from $900/kW to $1250/kW, depending on two factors: (1) the efficiency of the CHP system design, and (2) the host customer’s commitment to implement other energy efficiency measures that reduce onsite energy consumption. The combined incentives awarded to a single project cannot exceed 70% of the project costs. For more information, see National Grid’s Guide to Submitting CHP Applications for Incentives in Rhode Island (Version May 2016).

CHP is also an eligible measure for nonwires alternatives. The Least-Cost Procurement Standards state that approaches for nonwires solutions may include strategic promotion of CHP, subject to screening criteria.

Net metering: Applicable only to renewable energy systems, Rhode Island’s net metering rules are capped at fairly small system capacity limits.

Last Updated: August 2019
","Some additional supportive policies encourage CHP in Rhode Island. The Department of Environmental Management (DEM) has a policy intended to streamline air permitting for certain CHP systems. Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 43 creates an alternative permitting process (general permit) for certain emergency generators, CHP and other distributed generation projects. The general permit offers an administratively simpler process than the current minor source permitting process in APC Regulation No. 9. The application form is available here. The state has also codified the use of nonwires alternatives for promoting the state's policy goals of enhancing grid reliability and resilience. CHP is defined as an eligible measure for nonwires alternatives. 

Technical assistance is also available, as outlined in its annual Energy Efficiency Program Plan. National Grid offers assistance by identifying and recruiting qualified CHP projects, conducting initial scoping studies, and providing up to 50% of the cost of independent engineering studies.

Additionally, National Grid has defined criteria and incentives for 'opportunity fuel' CHP systems, specifically waste-to-gas, in the 2018 Energy Efficiency Annual Plan.

",20 out of 20,"Rhode Island has consistently achieved high levels of energy savings through its energy efficiency programs and has some of the most aggressive energy savings targets in the country. One investor-owned utility, Narragansett Electric (a National Grid Company), administers and operates a portfolio of energy efficiency programs for its customers, which account for 99% of statewide sales of electricity. A public utility, Pascoag Utility District, also operates programs. The Rhode Island legislature unanimously passed sweeping legislation in 2006, which, among other things, established the state's energy efficiency resource standard (EERS). The Comprehensive Energy Conservation, Efficiency and Affordability Act of 2006 requires utilities to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency. The act also establishes requirements for strategic long-term planning and purchasing of least-cost supply and demand resources and three-year energy saving targets. Enacted in 2010, House Bill 8082 authorizes revenue decoupling for electric and natural gas utilities and requires utilities to submit proposals to implement these policies.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","Energy efficiency programs are offered by Rhode Island's regulated distribution utilities. The major investor-owned utility operating in the state, Narragansett Electric, is a National Grid Company and offers a comprehensive slate of programs that parallel National Grid's offerings in Massachusetts. Hearings are held once a year before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission to review program plans. A collaborative of stakeholders reviews these plans and makes recommendations to the RI PUC on the programs. Program costs are trued up annually each May.

The Comprehensive Energy Conservation, Efficiency and Affordability Act of 2006 greatly increased the role and requirements for acquisition of demand-side resources, requiring utilities to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency. The act also created a statewide natural gas conservation program.

Utility programs are funded by a ""conservation and load adjustment factor""—a rider assessed on all customer rates established as part of Rhode Island's restructuring legislation. There is a minimum floor on this surcharge of 2 mills per kilowatt-hour for energy efficiency paid by customers of regulated distribution utilities as a non-bypassable public benefits fee specifically for energy efficiency programs. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission annually reviews and authorizes utility demand-side management program plans, including budget amounts. The fee to support energy efficiency is a floor; actual spending amounts have exceeded this minimum requirement.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

The Rhode Island legislature unanimously passed the Comprehensive Energy Conservation, Efficiency and Affordability Act of 2006 in June 2006. This act establishes a Least Cost Procurement mandate, requiring utilities to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency with input and review from the Energy Efficiency and Resource Management Council (EERMC). Under the Least Cost Procurement mandate, National Grid is required to participate in strategic long-term planning and invest in all energy efficiency that is cost-effective and cheaper than supply on behalf of its customers.

The act also established requirements for strategic long-term planning and purchasing of least-cost supply and demand resources. Utilities must submit 3-year and annual energy efficiency procurement plans, which offer program details, as well as spending and savings goals. Hearings are held once a year before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission to review program plans. Yearly incremental savings goals for electricity during the 2012-2014 period began at 1.7%, increasing to 2.5% in 2014 (Docket 4284, 4295). Targets for 2015-2017 ranged from 2.5% to 2.6%; 2.5% for 2018-2021 (Docket 4443).

Rhode Island’s EERS policy also includes natural gas targets. Savings goals for the 2012-2014 period ranged from 0.6% in 2012 to 1.0% in 2014 (Docket 4284, 4295). Targets for 2015-2017 ranged from 1% to 1.1%; ~0.97% for 2018-2020 (Docket 4443).

Evaluations are mainly administered by the utilities. Rhode Island has formal requirements for evaluation.?Statewide evaluations are conducted.?Deemed savings are used by the utility in evaluating cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency programs.?Evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs relies on regulatory orders and the Least Cost Procurement Standards. National Grid also provides a Technical Reference Manual and has offered the PUC access to an online Technical Reference Library, both of which show savings and costs on a measure level. 



According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Rhode Island relies on its own state-specific test as its primary cost-effectiveness test, which was developed using principles consistent with the National Standard Practice Manual. It is applied primarily at the portfolio level, but Rhode Island also uses it at the program and measure level.  Rhode Island’s test accounts for avoided costs of compliance with emissions regulations, participant health benefits and environmental benefits from reduced emissions. Rhode Island’s test accounts for non-energy costs and benefits associated with economic well-being, comfort, health and safety, other fuels, water savings, the social cost of carbon not embedded in energy market prices, economic development, and energy security from reduced use of fuel oil. 



Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Rhode Island is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The Comprehensive Energy Conservation, Efficiency and Affordability Act of 2006 requires utilities to acquire all cost-effective energy efficiency and establishes requirements for strategic long-term planning and purchasing of least-cost supply and demand resources, as well as three-year energy saving targets. In Docket No. 4580, National Grid’s Energy Efficiency Program Plan for 2016, funding for residential income eligible programs is set at 13.2% of total implementation funding for the electric programs and 20% for natural gas customers. These levels were adjusted to 13% and 21%, respectively, for 2017 in Docket No. 4654.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Docket No. 4443 outlines incremental electricity savings goals for 2015-2017 and notes that the Energy Efficiency Resource Management Council recommended including resource impacts and non-energy benefits in the TRC test analysis, but only to specific programs or technologies such as income-eligible programs or combined heat and power. Although Rhode Island General Laws require the consideration of non-energy benefits (NEBs) in the development of combined heat and power, there does not appear to be a similar provision in the General Laws for income-eligible programs. In the absence of non-energy impact evaluations of Rhode Island programs, the state has relied on Massachusetts’ benefit valuation work, as they have similar program types.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Rhode Island Department of Human Services (DHS), Division of Community Services is responsible for administration of the state’s WAP and LIHEAP programs. CLEAResult, which since 2013 has operated as the lead vendor for National Grid’s Income Eligible Services (IES) program, works collaboratively with DHS to deliver weatherization services to eligible Rhode Islanders. Although DOE funds and utility funds are not directly blended on DOE weatherization jobs, the relationship is beneficial to both parties by enabling sharing of energy efficiency knowledge and program expertise.

As an example, CLEAResult and DHS have formed a Weatherization Technical Committee (WTC), which meets on alternating months and is comprised of a technical representative from each CAP agency (i.e. an experienced energy auditor), the CLEAResult QA Manager, and the three state monitors to discuss best practices and develop policy on weatherization matters of a technical nature. DHS and CLEAResult have also worked collaboratively on the development of a RI WAP/IES Operations Manual, which will incorporate all applicable elements of WPN 15-4.

EVT, in partnership with PSD, has conducted several meetings for town officials on the updated building codes, including zoning administrators and code officials to discuss the energy code and the new requirements to obtain code compliance certificates prior to issuing Certificates of Occupancy. EVT has also started focusing some trainings to building supply store staff. Efficiency Vermont has a three year budget of $300,000 for energy code support including training to provide a basis for improving the overall level of code compliance, understanding, and construction practice.  The DPS provided $20,000 from the FY16 SEP Formula Grant and $20,000 from the FY17 SEP Formula Grant for energy code trainings.

","CHP in energy efficiency standards: Vermont Public Service Board (PSB) established a statewide energy efficiency utility, Efficiency Vermont, along with a funding mechanism to support it. Efficiency Vermont is administered by Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC), which is an independent, nonprofit corporation. The EEU implements that implements the state’s Energy Reduction Goals. The Order of Appointment (OOA) that describes the general responsibilities and scope of activities to be performed by the energy efficiency utility includes guidance related to project and savings eligibility for customer-sited generation including deployed CHP.

Last Updated: September 2018
","Incentives, grants, or financing: Efficiency Vermont provides some financial support for CHP projects in the state, as enabled by the 2016 Order of Appointment for VEIC.

The state of Vermont offers an Investment Tax Credit for eligible CHP systems and other renewable energy equipment on business properties. The incentive for CHP is 2.4% with a maximum system size of 50 MW.

Net metering:  Vermont's original net-metering legislation was enacted in 1998, and the law has been expanded several times subsequently. Any electric customer in Vermont may net meter after obtaining a Certificate of Public Good from the Vermont Public Service Board (PSB). An application for a Certificate of Public Good for Interconnected Net Metered Power Systems is available on the program web site listed above. Net metering is generally available to systems up to 250 kilowatts (kW) in capacity that generate electricity using micro-combined heat and power (CHP) systems up to 20 kW. CHP systems greater than 20 kW in capacity are not eligible for net metering.

Vermont also requires all distribution, sub-transmission, and transmission investments that pass initial screening to undergo review via the Vermont System Planning Committee, with recommnedations from that committee to the Public Utilities Commission as to whether non-wires alternatives are eligilbe. CHP is an eligible project to be considered.

",18 out of 20,"Vermont is and has been among the leading states for utility energy efficiency for many years and was the first to create a statewide ""energy efficiency utility."" Under Vermont’s 12-year ""Order of Appointment"" model, Efficiency Vermont and Burlington Electric Department deliver both electric and unregulated heating-and-process-fuel energy efficiency services to residential and business consumers throughout the state. The State EEU fiscal agent receives energy efficiency charge monies collected by the electric distribution companies and disburses the funds to the EEUs.

Vermont law requires program administrators to set budgets at a level that would realize ""all reasonably available, cost-effective energy efficiency.""

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","Vermont pioneered the model of a statewide ""energy efficiency utility"" (EEU) after enacting legislation in 1999 authorizing Vermont Public Service Board (PSB) to collect a volumetric (per kWh) charge on all electric utility customers’ bills to support energy efficiency programs, called the Energy Efficiency Charge (EEC). PSB created the EEU designation that Efficiency Vermont (EVT) and Burlington Electric Department (BED) currently operate under to invest in programs and services that save money and conserve energy. Vermont Gas Systems offers natural gas efficiency service within its territory. Natural gas efficiency programs are supported by legislation and regulation (30 V.S.A. Section 235(d); Docket No. 5270 VGS-1, 2) and began in 1993. The Public Service Board designated it an EEU with a 12-year Order of Appointment to deliver natural gas energy efficiency services in April 2015 (see Docket 7676).

New since 2015 is the passage of Act 56 of 2015, which creates a Renewable Energy Standard in Vermont. It creates an energy transformation obligation for electric distribution utilities, in which they must produce an increasing amount of fossil fuel use reductions attributable to their customers. They may meet the obligation through the use of more efficient heating systems (such as heat pumps) or through building weatherization, or even the use of more efficient or electric vehicles. The obligations begin in 2017 with an amount equivalent to 2% of the utility's sales, rising to 10% by 2032.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

Last reviewed: July 2019
","Vermont statute (30 VSA Sec. 218c) directs all electric and natural gas utilities to prepare and implement least cost integrated plans—plans ""for meeting the public's need for energy services, after safety concerns are addressed, at the lowest present value life cycle cost, including environmental and economic costs, through a strategy combining investments and expenditures on energy supply, transmission and distribution capacity, transmission and distribution efficiency, and comprehensive energy efficiency programs."" In addition, Vermont has a well-established regulatory process to factor the Energy Efficiency Utility's energy savings into utility companies' load forecasts. Vermont law requires EEU budgets to be set at a level that would realize ""all reasonably available, cost-effective energy efficiency.""

Last reviewed: July 2019
","Summary: Electric - Annual incremental savings totaling 357,400 MWh over 2018-2020, or approximately 2.4% of annual sales. Natural gas - Three-year annual incremental savings of 192,599 Mcf spanning 2018-2020, or 0.5% of sales.

Vermont does not have traditional EERS legislation with a set schedule of energy-savings percentages for each year. Instead, Vermont law requires EEU budgets to be set at a level that would realize ""all reasonably available, cost-effective energy efficiency."" Compensation and specific energy-savings levels—not “soft” goals or targets—are then negotiated with EEU contractor Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC). There is not an explicit penalty for non-performance. However, a portion of the compensation Vermont pays the administrator is contingent on meeting stated goals, subject to a monitoring and verification process. If the administrator does not meet stated goals, the state will withhold compensation, and the administrator potentially will be replaced at the end of the three-year period (DSIRE 2011).

Vermont Public Service approved a 2012-2014 budget for Efficiency Vermont, set to achieve approximately 2% annual savings (VT Public Service Board Docket EEU-2010-06). Current targets established in the Efficiency Vermont Triennial Plan for 2018-2021 call for 357,400 MWh of savings, or approximately 2.4% of annual sales.

The goal-setting process has changed due to Vermont’s “order of appointment” franchise-like structure. Every three years, a “demand resources plan” proceeding will be held. The proceeding will set budgets and goals for the next 20 years, coinciding with the long-range transmission plan to allow for integration of forecasting (EEU Structure Docket 7466).

VEIC and BED have been awarded Orders of Appointment as Energy Efficiency Utilities for a period of 12 years. Every 6 years there is a review as to if this appointment should be extended an additional 6 years. The 2015-2017 budget is set to achieve a 2.25% level of savings increasing to 2.32% by 2017 (EEU-2013-01 2013-2014 Demand Resources Plan Proceeding 7/9/2014).

Vermont Gas Systems has also been designated an EEU with a 12-year Order of Appointment to deliver natural gas energy efficiency services as of April 2015 (see Docket 7676). Natural gas targets have been set at 192,599 Mcf spanning 2018-2020, or 0.5% of sales (EEU-2016-03: PUC Order on 10/12/17 re: Performance Targets).

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Vermont relies on both legislative mandates (30 V.S.A. §209) and regulatory orders (Process and Administration of an Order of Appointment). Evaluations are mainly administered by the Vermont Public Service Department. There are no specific legal requirements for these evaluations in Vermont. Statewide evaluations are conducted.  



Vermont specifies the societal cost test (SCT) to be its primary test for decision making. The benefit-cost test is applied primarily at the portfolio level. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in?30 V.S.A. §203?and?218b?and?Docket No. 5980. Vermont has a DSS (Development and Support Services) category that designates funding for activities that are worthwhile but do not necessarily return quantifiable savings. According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Vermont’s SCT accounts for other fuel (natural gas, oil propane, kerosene, wood) and water savings, as well as avoided costs of compliance with emissions regulations and renewable energy standard requirements through monetized estimates. Vermont’s SCT also accounts for costs and benefits associated with improved public health, participant health, environmental benefits, participant comfort, economic development and jobs, energy security and others in a 15% adder.   



Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Vermont is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Efficiency Vermont (EVT), the state’s energy efficiency utility established in 1999, is funded through a systems benefits charge on all utility customers’ bills. Vermont requires that EVT achieve a minimum level of low-income services spending (for the 2015-2017 period the requirement is $10.5 million). Most of the costs of the electric efficiency measures implemented by EVT and the community-based weatherization agencies are paid for by EVT, with any remaining balances covered by the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Other funding for WAP comes from the state’s Weatherization Trust Fund, which was created in 1990 through legislative enactment of a gross-receipts tax of 0.5% on all non-transportation fuels sold in the state. 

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Vermont specifies the Social Cost Test to be its primary test for decision making. A 15% adjustment is applied to the cost-effectiveness screening tool for low-income customer programs.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Vermont Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) administers the Vermont Home Weatherization Assistance Program (HWAP), which includes both state and federal funds. OEO monitors and provides training and technical assistance to five non?profit community Weatherization Assistance Programs. Efficiency Vermont supplements the state weatherization program with add-on measures beyond what would otherwise be included in the state- and federally-funded WAP. These measures include ENERGY STAR-qualified refrigerators, ENERGY STAR-qualified clothes washers, lighting, ventilation fans, and smart power strips. Efficiency Vermont continually assesses potential new measures to include in the scope of the add-on program and has updated its offerings to include heat pump water heaters, dehumidifiers, and mini-split heat pumps. Community Action Program agencies offer these measures as a part of the same program delivery as the state weatherization program, so customers must interact with only one program.

","For electric energy efficiency, there are three self-direct options available statewide: SMEEP (Self-Managed Energy Efficiency Program), CCP (Customer Credit Program) and ESA (Energy Savings Accounts). SMEEP is also available for the one eligible gas customer.

The SMEEP options require prospective participants or their successors to have contributed $1.5 million to the Energy Efficiency Fund in 2008 through the Efficiency Charge added on their electric costs to meet the requirements. Only one customer meets that standard. Additionally, an eligible customer must commit to investing a minimum of $3 million over a three-year program cycle. This program was recently expanded to allow a second customer to be eligible but these requirements have not yet been set through the PUC process and will include additional metrics such as productivity. For SMEEP electric, an eligible customer must demonstrate that it has a comprehensive energy management program with annual objectives or demonstrate that it has achieved certification of ISO standard 14001. They then provide a report to the Public Service Board (PSB) detailing the measures undertaken, estimated savings and related costs. These reports are then reviewed and approved by the PSB. 

In addition, the Vermont Public Service Board has established an option for eligible Vermont business customers to self-administer energy efficiency through the use of an Energy Savings Account (ESA) or the Customer Credit Program. These funds are still paid into the VEEUF and disbursed to the participants upon completion of an eligible energy efficiency measure. The ESA option allows Vermont businesses that pay an Energy Efficiency Charge (EEC) in excess of $5,000 total per year (or an average $5,000 total per year over three years) to use a portion of their EEC to support energy efficiency projects in their facilities. The ESA is run through the Efficiency Vermont program and related savings are reported and verified through the Savings Verification mechanism.

For CCP, eligible customers must be ISO 14001-certified and meet several conditions similar to Energy Star for industrial facilities. For natural gas energy efficiency, eligible only for transmission and industrial electric and natural gas ratepayers, customer efficiency charges for electric usage must be a minimum of $1.5 million. A pilot program is being developed to allow customers selected through a competitive process to be able to self-direct a large portion of the funds collected through the electric EEC paid by that customer to both electric and thermal energy efficency projects. This pilot is capped at $2 million annually.

","Guidelines for Third Party Access

In Vermont, it is a generally accepted legal precept that there is a protected privacy interest in customer energy information. Energy providers, EEUs, the Public Service Department, along with the Public Service Board, all acknowledge that this information is confidential. Utilities and fuel dealers generally only release customer data with their customer’s written permission. 

Requirements for Provision of Energy Data

The PSD will be submitting a request this year for the Vermont Public Service Board to convene a proceeding on commercial, multifamily, and mixed-use building benchmarking and labeling to investigate consideration of establishing a system for delivery of aggregated energy data to building owners and their agents for use in buildings with tenants. 

Energy Use Data Availability

In the pending request mentioned above, the board will also be asked to address data transfer standardization. Some, but not all, Vermont utilities have implemented Green Button, but all are interested and willing to investigate the costs and benefits of providing consumers with a mechanism to facilitate these benchmarking and labeling efforts. As mentioned above, the Board will also be asked to address data transfer standardization.

","BuildSmart NY is one of Governor Cuomo’s Statewide initiatives to accelerate energy efficiency in State buildings, while incorporating broader State policy goals to foster cost-effective investment, stimulate the clean energy marketplace, advance energy security and resiliency and protect the environment and public health. At the center of BuildSmart NY is Executive Order 88, requiring a 20% improvement in energy efficiency at State owned and managed buildings by the year 2020. While this requirement does not mandate localities to comply with the requirements, localities are encouraged to do so and some have adopted their own requirements (e.g. New York City).


In his 2012 State of the State Address, Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced a master plan for accelerating energy-saving improvements in state facilities. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) was tasked to finance approximately $800 million in cost-effective energy efficiency projects between then and 2017. The financing provided has already helped reduce energy consumption in state buildings by over 16%, and will be directed toward the largest and most inefficient buildings. Since the program’s initiation, NYPA has implemented 95 BuildSmart NY projects that are yielding an annual $49 million in savings for State agencies.  

In August 2013, NYPA published the BuildSmart NY Baseline Energy Performance of New York State Government Buildings. The report represented New York State’s first effort to benchmark the energy use of State government buildings. Annual reports have been issued each year. Key findings of the original baseline report, include:


	Portfolio weighting: More than 90% of the State’s building square footage and energy consumption is associated with six large New York State government Agencies. The resources and the initiatives implemented at these key state Agencies will therefore be critical to the overall achievement of Executive Order 88 goals.
	Master-metered campuses: The State’s portfolio was largely comprised of large, master-metered campuses with groups of buildings all served by the same utility meter. In most cases the resulting data is available weeks, or even months, after the energy has been used. Submetering has been a major push of the initiative.
	Portfolio facility imbalance: A small number of State facilities (including some master-metered campuses) represent a disproportionate amount of total consumption. Just 19 State facilities represent more than 40% of the portfolio’s total energy use, and just 75 facilities represent more than 75% of the energy use.


To help address the need for facility managers to have detailed performance information in a timely basis, in 2014 NYPA established the NY Energy Manager, or NYEM. NYEM was established to provide public facilities with real-time data on their energy use, enabling constant commissioning improvements in buildings, and helping to identify changes in energy performance and facilitate cost-effective investments in the State’s assets.


NYPA’s BuildSmart work has been enhanced by its New York Energy Manager (NYEM) program. NYEM is a secure smart grid system that tracks the energy usage of participating facilities in real time. The program uses the data to provide key insights about building operations and identify opportunities for savings. Currently, NYEM hosts utility data for 3,500 State buildings and is live connected to 1,200 buildings. NYPA plans to expand the system and its services to a total of 20,000 buildings over the next five years. NYPA has constructed its NYEM facility as a hub where technology companies, utilities, system operators, and research centers can use the information to create new products and services for customers. In addition to warehousing EO88 data, NYEM provides web-based access to the platform for use by facilities personnel. Through this portal, building managers have virtual access to their raw building data as well as a variety of pre-built “widgets” that provide visual interpretations of building data to help identify opportunities for energy savings. NYPA is in the process of hiring third-party energy consultants to provide technical and advisory services for state agencies and authorities in NYEM. Furthermore, NYPA is evaluating the opportunity to allow private commercial sector users into NYEM sometime in the future.

As part of BuildSmart NY, NYPA initiated the Five Cities Energy Plans for the cities of Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers aim to reduce overall energy costs and consumption, strengthen the reliability of each city's energy infrastructure, create jobs in local clean energy industries, and contribute to a cleaner environment. With NYPA funding and technical assistance, the Five Cities are implementing a variety of energy efficiency projects that will enable them to reduce municipal energy consumption 20 percent by 2020. These projects are facilitated with the support of NYPA-funded staff and a total of $4 million in grants provided by NYPA to the Five Cities. Since the program’s launch in 2015, energy efficiency measures, such as lighting, HVAC upgrades, and building controls, have been installed in over 200 municipal-based locations across the Five Cities.


A second major component of Governor Cuomo’s policy plan for state assets to lead by example on energy issues is Executive Order No. 166, directing state agencies to redouble their efforts to fight against and economic and environmental threats posed by climate change, and affirming the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. Issued on June 2, 2017, EO166 directs all state agencies and authorities to develop a plan to achieve a 40% greenhouse gas reduction across all operations. Furthermore, EO166 directs state agencies and authorities to review their service offerings, policies and programs and make adjustments as appropriate to enable their programs and policies to help achieve greenhouse gas reductions in the State.

Following the issuance of the EO166 guidance document in late 2017, the Governor issued additional guidance as part of his 2018 State of the State address. In this address, the Governor directed NYSERDA and the NYS Department of Public Service (DPS), in consultation with the Department of Environmental Conservation and other key stakeholders, to establish a new set of Lead by Example policy guidance. The new guidance was developed and issued in April, which includes significant changes to current agency operations. By 2021, all agencies and authorities with a utility bill of $300,000 or more must have a Energy Master Plan that is updated at least every 5 years. New York has established a schedule of all new construction and gut rehabilitation projects to be designed to be net zero over the next decade. All state agencies and authorities must replace all lighting indoor and outdoor by 2025 with LED technologies. All state agencies and authorities must install all measures that are identified via audits, master plans or energy models that have a 10 year or less simple payback. All facilities that will be replacing a HVAC system must sequence building envelope upgrades prior to the replacement of the HVAC system. There will also be a new benchmarking policy implemented in advance of a new statewide benchmarking legislation that is being submitted. Also for the first time, a comprehensive policy and efficiency reduction is in place for process and other unregulated loads, significantly expanding the amount of energy that will be included in efficiency work across the state.


At the beginning of 2017, NYPA launched a Race-to-the-Top initiative to accelerate the progress being made in the Cities. Approximately $3.6 million will be allocated to 10 winning projects selected by an evaluation committee. The projects were evaluated in the categories of Cost Effectiveness & Energy Savings, Relevance to their City Energy Plan, Shovel-readiness, Reinvestment, and Innovation. All projects are scheduled to be implemented in 2017 and 2018.

As part of New York’s Reforming the Energy Vision (REV), NYSERDA launched a Clean Energy Communities program in August 2016. This program is a coordinated State-level effort to engage and standardize local and municipal efforts in ways that drive energy efficiency and renewable energy projects at scale. The program created a list of 10 high impact initiatives that each municipality can implement to earn a Clean Energy Community designation. One of the primary policy goals the program advocates for is the implementation of Benchmarking laws, requiring public disclosure of building energy consumption.

New Efficiency: New York directs state agencies and authorities to design new construction to Net Zero Energy (NZE) or Net Zero Carbon when technically and economically viable, beginning in 2020 for low-rise office buildings. By 2025, all new construction in dorms, housing, and public assembly buildings should be designed to be NZE and by 2030, new construction for all building typologies should be designed to be NZE. Where an agency or authority can document that NZE is not technically or economically viable, buildings will need to be designed to exceed the New York State Energy Conservation Construction Code by a minimum of 20%. New Efficiency: New York specifies that by 2019, each State agency or authority that owns and operates a building that is eligible to receive an ENERGY STAR score in the U.S. EPA’s Portfolio Manager (PM) benchmarking tool will annually benchmark and disclose the PM score for that building. The State shall annually gather and publish the critical energy performance data of facilities not scorable in the PM system.

","New York does not have an overall fleet efficiency standard or target, however, the state is partnering with municipalities to expand state and local ownership of electric vehicles. Additionally, NYSERDA and the NYPA are working with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to reduce its energy consumption.


State agencies are also required to purchase or lease vehicles, which have a fuel economy in the top 30% of their vehicle class as listed under EPA size class on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maintained website at http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml, as per Executive Order No. 4 (2008), which was continued by Governor Cuomo in Executive Order No. 2 (2011). In addition, the Department of Environmental Conservation and the Office of General Services conduct annual aggregate purchases for Zero Emission Vehicles from which state agencies can benefit.


Note: For state efficient fleet initiatives, policies listed must make a specific, mandatory requirement for increasing state fleet efficiency. State alternative-fuel vehicle procurement requirements that give a voluntary option to count efficient vehicles are thus not included.

","The New York Power Authority (NYPA) has been offering its Energy Services Program for 25 years. Between 1987 and 2018, NYPA has financed and invested over $2.3 billion across 4,000 facilities within New York State. Under this Energy Services Program, NYPA provides services that include developing feasibility studies, engineering design, life-cycle cost analyses, procuring equipment, contractor labor, hazardous waste disposal, managing projects/construction and financing projects. Measures include, but are not limited to: lighting retrofits, building envelop-related improvements, HVAC modernization, including energy-efficient chillers, boilers, and controls, high-efficiency motors, variable-speed drives, energy management systems, process controls, and distributed generation. These installations, and many more, have been performed throughout the NYPA customer base. New York State governmental entities, municipalities, school districts, public housing authorities, wastewater treatment plants, prisons, hospitals, museums, zoos, and public colleges are all continuing participants in the NYPA program. In 2014, NYPA initiated approximately $240 million in energy efficiency projects across over 260 public buildings statewide. The programs are implemented without performance guarantees which are traditionally offered by ESCOs. NYPA has been steadily expanding its program services and is on track to exceed $300M in 2018. DASNY also has the authorizing language to support performance contracting, and many municipalities and K-12 schools issue their own procurements independently to obtain performance contracting services.

	Gap Analysis/Strategic Compliance Plan: NYS performed a Gap Analysis and strategic compliance plan, or Action Plan.  Draft report was prepared April 2016, describing both Gap Analysis findings as well as an Action Plan for proposed measures to improve Energy Code compliance and enforcement. Gap Analysis findings included in-depth interviews with approximately 150 design, construction and enforcement professionals, as well as building owners and representatives from state and local government.  Gap Analysis also include a survey of approximately 450 NYS code enforcement officials and review of state wide compliance assessments and market intervention strategies designed to improve compliance and enforcement performed to date.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: In 2011, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) completed a baseline compliance assessment of new residential and commercial buildings in response to New York State’s goal of reaching 90% compliance with the Energy Conservation Construction Code of New York State-2010 (ECCCNYS) by 2017, a condition of receiving federal funds through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The baseline study examined residential new construction permitted under the ECCCNYS-2007 and commercial new construction permitted under Standard 90.1 2004 and 2007 and, in general, followed U.S. DOE protocol for measuring compliance. The study also established rates of compliance by U/A Alternative method using REScheck and COMcheck software. The study found residential new construction compliance rates of 73% and 61% (DOE protocol and REScheck, respectively) and commercial new construction compliance rates of 85% and 36% (DOE protocol and COMcheck, respectively). In 2015, NYSERDA completed a second baseline study of commercial renovations. On average, the study found that 100% of the sampled projects met code.  The study examined a relatively small sample size and primarily included projects of limited scope: 68% mechanical and domestic hot water, 26% lighting and 6% the building envelope. NYSERDA has found traditional compliance measurement efforts challenging in terms of cost, duration and data reliability.  To respond to these challenges, NYSERDA will take a different approach and conduct two Delphi Panel processes with a group of experts in new and existing residential and commercial sector design, construction and enforcement, to gather information on the frequency and quality of specific building practices employed in the State. Through the iterative process of collecting expert opinion and building consensus between experts, NYSERDA will analyze building practices and code compliance to estimate a baseline energy code compliance level for the State.   This estimate will be updated during the second Delphi Panel, multiple years later, in order to track how compliance changes over time and what the major contributing factors are for changing compliance levels.  
	Utility Involvement: In October 2011, the New York State Public Service Commission issued an Order that includes over $16 million in funding for Advanced Energy Codes and Standards as part of NYSERDA's Technology and Marketing Development Program Operating Plan for 2012-2016. Long Island Power Authority has developed HERS infrastructure to promote codes and provides financial support for towns that adopt ENERGY STAR specifications as the local code. NYSERDA is planning three publications for late 2016, including a code enforcement manual, a manual for enforcing performance based compliance, a best practices manual for design professionals and a Code/Commentary specific to the October 3, 2016 update. Since third quarter 2015, NYSERDA has made available to municipalities free plan review, inspection and other energy code support. Finally, NYS is in the process of developing a stretch energy code for optional local adoption.  An advisory committee and working group of stakeholders is involved in developing the stretch code and a draft code is expected late 2016.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: NYSERDA staff, DOS, and contractors conduct regular meetings with the code enforcement, design and construction communities. In October 2014, NYSERDA hosted an Energy Code Working Group, composed of code enforcement officials, design professionals, energy professionals, DOS and other stakeholders, to gain feedback on ongoing training and support services offered by NYSERDA, as well as future needs. NYSERDA didn't host an energy code working group meeting in 2015. The 2014 working group meeting helped inform all SBC4 solicitations which produced all market intervention projects currently underway.  Regular stakeholder involvement is ongoing as part of planning the 2016 Energy Code Conference, NYStretch Code, and pending enforcement/compliance best practices publications planned for late 2016.

",2.5 out of 3,"New York has adopted strong policies and programs to support the deployment of CHP. In June 2017, Executive Order #166 Redoubling New York's Fight Against the Economic and Environmental Threats Posed by Climate Change and Affirming the Goals of the Paris Climate Agreement was signed, explicitly supporting high efficiency combined heat and power projects as part of its portfolio towards meeting policy goals. There were 33 new CHP installations completed in 2018.
","Policy: New York State Standardized Interconnection Requirements and Application Process for New Distributed Generators 5 MW or Less Connected in Parallel with Utility Distribution Systems (SIR).

Description: In 1999, New York became the second state in the country to adopt an interconnection standard and they have been periodically revised since. A 2015 REV Order directed the implementation of a process to raise the threshold applicability from 2 MW and the SIR was updated in March 2016 to apply to systems up to 5 MW. The standard is consistent with IEEE’s 1547 interconnection standard and explicitly allows for the interconnection of CHP systems. While the NYSIR interconnection standard applies up to 5 MW, the utilities with service territory covering the majority of the state have procedures that include systems up to 20 MW. The SIR was updated again in 2018 to enhance the interconnection process for distributed generation, such as CHP, paired with energy storage systems.

","CHP in energy efficiency standards: In April 2007, Governor Spitzer set a new policy goal to reduce electricity use in 2015 by 15% (“15 by 15”), relative to projected use in 2015. In June 2008, the New York Public Service Commission issued an Order Establishing Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) and Approving Programs. As New York looks beyond EEPS and toward more market-based transformation efforts through the Clean Energy Fund, it will pursue both resource acquisition and market transformation strategies.

CHP programs:  The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has some of the most extensive experience implementing statewide programs to encourage CHP. After 2015, the incentive program has been a continuation/modification of NYSERDA's previous CHP Acceleration and Aggregation Program (Program Opportunity Notice 2568) and CHP Performance Program (Program Opportunity Notice 2701). These two separate programs have been merged into a single offering, issued as ""The CHP Program"" and labeled as Program Opportunity Notice 2568. The market transformation activities will strive to reduce soft costs, reduce cycle times, and increase monetization of values, by simplifying and accelerating customer acquisition, facilitating project replication through standardized model contract terms and conditions, and establishing consensus-based methodologies for calculating/analyzing costs/savings data and for assigning a monetized value to the enhanced resiliency provided by CHP. One significant change to NYSERDA’s CHP program, however, is a reduction in eligible system size to 3MW and a future scaling down of incentive levels. 

In February 2019, NYSERDA announced that they would no longer be accepting new applications for the CHP catalog program, the flagship incentive program, which has a long history of supporting CHP projects, reporting that project developers are able to proceed with their projects without subsidies going forward due to market maturity enabled by long-term investments. Additionally, NYSERDA will no longer fund CHP systems fueled only by natural gas. All units must be accompanied by solar or storage systems to be eligible for future funding.

Production goal: The Clean Energy Fund Investment Plan documents the state’s program budget for acquisition of a defined amount of MWh from CHP resources. The plan includes a three-year budget of approximately $48 million in incentives and services for CHP installations. This level of investment is expected to result in 220,000 MWh in resource acquisition and a reduction of 1,710,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent during the three-year period.

Last Updated: August 2019
","Incentives, grants, and financing: NYSERDA's Program Opportunity Notice 2568 makes up to $82 million available for CHP installations through 2018. Specifically, NYSERDA will provide financial incentives for the installation of grid-connected CHP systems at customer sites that pay the Systems Benefit Charge (SBC) on their electric bill, or if new construction, will pay the SBC surcharge on the electric bill once interconnected.

The CHP Program is available to systems 3 MW and smaller, in addition to incentives, it provides consumer protection regarding quality of equipment, and consumer protection regarding project right-sizing. Quality of equipment is addressed through a streamlined approach based on a NYSERDA-developed list of pre-approved standardized packaged CHP modules in sizes 3 MW and smaller, or a case-by-case rigorous review of custom-engineered CHP systems size 1 MW and to 3 MW (in the 1 MW to 3 MW overlap range, applicants can opt for either a pre-engineered approach or a custom-engineered approach and will receive the identical incentive either way). Assurances of right-sizing of projects can proceed through a streamlined approach based on a NYSERDA-developed set of ""rules of thumb"" sizing guidelines, or a case-by-case rigorous review of custom-sized project designs.

In 2016, Con Edison leveraged the NYSERDA-run program and offered an added incentive to projects that apply to NYSERDA for CHP funding until May 31, 2016 and filed a Notice of Intent to participate in the Brooklyn Queens Demand Management Program by May 31, 2016. The purpose of the partnered program is to minimize the burden of participation in two programs and maximize the incentive for CHP to fast-track deployment of CHP resources in a transmission-constrained, high-demand load pocket of New York state. Con Edison matched NYSERDA's base incentive up to $1,800/kW (or 100% of the project cost, whichever was less). The Public Service Commission subsequently authorized all of the investor-owned utilities to conduct non-wires solutions programs, which were rolled-out in 2017 and include CHP as an eligible measure.

Net metering: New York is transitiong to a Value of Distributed Energy Resources (VDER) pricing mechanism being phased in for CHP by a working group. Resources that were interconnected prior to March 9, 2017 are grandfathered into the previous net metering mechanism unless they opt for the VDER tariff. The previous net-metering was available to customers of investor-owned utilities for non-residential fuel cells up to 1.5 MW and residential micro-CHP up to 10 kW.

Last Updated: July 2018
","There are many additional supportive policies to encourage CHP in New York. Through its Flex Tech program, NYSERDA provides cost share for CHP feasibility studies, including “CHP-plus” configurations such as the pairing of CHP-plus-Storage. Through the first phase of its NY Prize Community Grid Competition, NYSERDA provided funding for 83 microgrid studies, the majority of which included CHP. In 2017, eleven of these projects advanced to the second phase of the NY Prize competition, all of which include CHP. NYSERDA also provides one-on-one coaching with potential CHP candidate sites and recommissioning assistance for CHP sites that have been operating for two years. CHP systems are assessed and a recommissioning report is produced, which includes recommendations to improve system operations or update hardware.

NYSERDA's programs prioritize grid resiliency and generally require systems to have the ability to operate during grid outages. Bonus incentives may be available for CHP projects serving critical infrastructure. Also, New York customers using natural gas for CHP may be eligible for discounted natural gas rates.

The state also has a decade-plus of effort encouraging renewable-fueled CHP systems through its renewable portfolio standard (RPS) adopted by the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) in September 2004, and transitioned in February 2016 to the Clean Energy Fund. This has typically taken the form of anaerobic digester biogas fueling of CHP systems at dairy farms, food production facilities, and water resource recovery plants.

",14 out of 20,"New York is a leading state on utility-sector energy efficiency programs. New York’s energy efficiency programs are the result of New York Public Service Commission (PSC) cases dating back to 1996. Customers pay a non-bypassable system benefits charge (SBC) on their utility bills, and the SBC is applied to all customer bills whether they receive service from a local utility or from a competitive supplier. The charge supports a comprehensive set of energy efficiency programs for residential, multifamily, low-income, and commercial/industrial customers, as well as research and development efforts in both the Commission’s Technology & Market Development (T&MD) and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) programs. In addition to the programs authorized by the Commission, two public power authorities not under the Commission’s jurisdiction, the New York Power Authority and the Long Island Power Authority, also offer energy efficiency programs to their customers.

New York set a statewide 2025 target of 185 TBtu of end-use savings across fuels (see New Efficiency, New York report), including a sub-target for annual electricity savings to reach 3% of investor-owned utility electric sales by 2025. The PSC established specific incremental annual energy savings targets for each utility for 2019 and 2020 and adopted an overall increase in the energy savings goal across the investor-owned utilities through 2025, more than doubling utility energy efficiency savings targets over the 2019-2025 period relative to historic levels.  

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","Customers of New York’s regulated electric distribution utilities and natural gas utilities support the statewide energy efficiency and other public benefits energy programs. These utilities include: Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Orange and Rockland Utilities, Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation (RG&E), National Fuel Distribution Corporation, Corning National Gas Corporation, St, Lawrence Gas, Company, Inc., KeySpan Energy Delivery New York, and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island.

Customers pay a non-bypassable system benefits charge (SBC) on their utility bills. A non-bypassable charge is a charge applied to all customer bills in a given region whether they receive service from a local utility or from a competitive supplier. The New York system benefits charge supports a comprehensive set of energy efficiency programs for customers, including residential, multifamily, low-income, commercial/industrial, and research and development programs. A state government authority, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), administers the SBC programs. NYSERDA and its contractors implement energy efficiency programs. The NYPSC's June 2008 Order Establishing Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) and Approving Programs (Case 07-M-0548) allows utility companies to administer some of the new, fast-track and expedited programs. Two public power authorities, the New York Power Authority and the Long Island Power Authority, also offer SBC-funded programs.

As a result of a REV order by the Commission in 2015, IOUs began in 2017 to recover energy efficiency program costs through rates like other business components of the revenue requirement as such program became more integrated into the utilities’ businesses.

A March 2018 PSC order led to the development of a Gross Savings Verification Guidance in accordance with which utilities will begin reporting programmatic performance as gross savings adjusted by EM&V methods that verify key factors used to calculate savings (such as the actual installation and operation of the measure, the size, efficiency level, hours of operation, etc.) but unadjusted for free-ridership and spillover effects.

","Summary: New York State has established a 2025 target to achieve 185 Tbtu savings (see New Efficiency, New York report), which will be approximately 3% of incremental electric sales. The PSC has yet to establish specific incremental annual energy savings targets for each utility. 

In 2008, the New York State Public Service Commission established the New York Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) proceeding. As part of a statewide program to reduce electricity usage by 15% of the forecast levels by the year 2015, with comparable results in natural gas conservation, the Commission established interim targets and funding through the year 2011. The Commission required utilities to file energy efficiency programs, and NYSERDA, as well as independent parties, were invited to submit energy efficiency program proposals for Commission approval. In 2011, the Commission reauthorized a majority of the EEPS programs for the four-year period ending December 31, 2015, with revised targets and budgets where appropriate. NYSERDA was authorized to operate a limited number of programs through December 31, 2018. Additionally, three gas efficiency programs run by National Fuel Gas Corporation pursuant to its rate cases were consolidated into the EEPS program.

In 2014, New York initiated a proceeding, Case 14-M-0101, ""Reforming the Energy Vision,"" to further discuss the state's energy efficiency resource standard, along with other major elements of the state's utility regulatory structure.  On February 26, 2015, the Commission issued an order in Case 14-M-0101 that, among other things, established a new framework for post-2015 electric energy efficiency programs. A similar framework is expected to be established for gas energy efficiency programs—a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the NYS Register on April 15, 2015. A new case, 15-M-0252, was established for the utilities post-2015 energy efficiency programs.


In January 2016, the PSC authorized NYSERDA's Clean Energy Fund (CEF) framework, which outlines a minimum 10-year energy efficiency goal of 10.6 million MWh measured in cumulative first-year savings.  Explicit energy efficiency budgets and targets for 2016 were aso established, along with an annual process whereby utilities would propose post-2016 energy efficiency budgets and targets for approval. This included the filing of Energy Efficiency Transition Implementation Plans (ETIPs), to address the energy efficiency efforts specifically associated with proposed budgets and targets. In 2017, NYS utilities began transitioning from energy efficiency programs being funded through a surcharge to a more integrated approach with costs recovered through rates like other ordinary components of the revenue requirement.  In several recent rate orders, the PSC has approved increased energy savings targets and system peak reduction levels incremental to the ETIPs, as well as alternative cost recovery mechanisms.

To date, IOUs have filed ETIPS with incremental savings targets varying from 0.4% to 0.9% for electric, and averaging 0.3% for gas, through 2020. NYSERDA's Clean Energy Fund (CEF) Framework outlines a minimum 10-year energy efficiency goal of 10.6 million MWh measured in cumulative first year savings (approximately 0.7% incremental annual savings).


In April 2018, DPS and NYSERDA issued a white paper, New Efficiency: New York, which established a statewide all-fuels target of 185 TBtu cumulative annual site energy savings for 2015-2025, relative to forecasted site energy consumption in 2025.  The white paper also provided a number of strategies the state could pursue in order to achieve the goal.  The Commission is expected to act on those aspects of the white paper over which it has jurisdiction, including assigning additional utility energy savings targets and establishing specific policy directives.

In December 2018, the PSC approved new energy efficiency targets for investor-owned utilities for 2019 and 2020 and adopted an overall increase in the energy savings goal to be achieved across the investor-owned utilities through 2025; this action more than doubled utility energy efficiency savings targets over the 2019-2025 period relative to sustaining historic (2017) targets.  The overall goal established in the December 2018 PSC Order was inclusive of a subsidiary target to reach an annual three percent reduction in electricity sales by 2025, and of a minimum 5 TBtu subtarget for savings from the installation of heat pumps.  Twenty percent of the additional levels of energy efficiency investment are to be dedicated to low- and moderate-income households.  In April 2019, the NY Utilities filed a report with their own proposal for the increased 2021 through 2025 targets for each utility.

Both utilities and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) administer program evaluations, statewide evaluations, and evaluations for each utility. A technical reference manual, which provides formulas and input and many input values for savings, is in use (Technical Reference Manual). See the Order Authorizing Utility-Administered Energy Efficiency Portfolio Budgets and Targets for 2019-2020 (Issued and effective March 15, 2018) for updates on TRM use.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in New York relies on Evaluation, Measurement and Verification Guidance issued November 1, 2016. According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP),  the societal cost test (SCT) is used in New York as the primary test for decision making. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in case 14-M-0101, Proceeding on Motion of the Commission in Regard to Reforming the Energy Vision.  The primary assessment level is the portfolio.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The EmPower New York program, administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) under an agreement with the New York Public Service Commission (PSC), offers no-cost energy services for households with incomes at or less than 60% of state median income.

A January 2016 PSC Order authorizing the Clean Energy Fund Framework requires that NYSERDA “must invest at least $234.5 million of Market Development funds in Low-to-Moderate Income (LMI) initiatives over the initial three year period.”

Market Development is one of four distinct portfolios supported by the Clean Energy Fund; the others include Innovation & Research, NY-Sun, and the NY Green Bank.

In the December 13, 2018 Order Approving Accelerated Energy Efficiency Targets, the NYS PSC ordered that a minimum of 20% of incremental energy efficiency funding, approximately $330 million, be directed towards initiatives to increase adoption of energy efficiency in the LMI market segment between 2019 and 2025.   The Order also requires the utilities to work with NYSERDA to develop an LMI portfolio that would include all ratepayer funded initiatives directed at improving energy affordability and access to clean energy solutions for LMI customers.  The portfolio would include the $70 million that NYSERDA directs towards LMI initiatives each year. Beginning in 2017, KeySpan Gas East Corporation (KEDLI) was required to implement an energy efficiency program for low income customers to replace the EmPower New York program (“EmPower Replacement Program”).  The program is available to customers who qualify for participation in KEDLI’s Residential Reduced Rate Low Income Program.  Consolidated Edison’s Multifamily Program provides its eligible low-income customers packaged measures including energy efficiency products and educational services.  Every customer who applies to the program may be able to qualify for one of two exclusive participation tracks: affordable housing track for buildings that receive designated low-income subsidies or Brooklyn Queens Demand Management (BQDM) Neighborhood track for buildings located within targeted Brooklyn-Queens neighborhoods, for which Con Edison is providing additional demand-side management resources.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

New York screens programs at the measure level and requires each to have a TRC score of at least 1.0 with some exceptions. It appears that New York’s TRC test does not explicitly address non-energy benefits of low-income programs. However, the New York PSC has generally recognized and considered low-income specific benefits in deciding on funding for utility low-income programs. For example, in a 2010 Order, the commission approved a low-income program with a TRC ratio of 0.91, finding that “…As a general principle, all customers should have reasonable opportunities to participate in and benefit from EEPS programs. It is also important that supplemental funding be provided to address gas efficiency measures in this program.”

Coordination of Low-Income and WAP Services

The Division of Housing and Community Renewal (HCR) Office of Housing Preservation is responsible for administration of New York’s Weatherization Assistance Program. HCR works with the New York State Public Service Commission, NYSERDA, and other agencies to help ensure that needs of low-income clients are addressed through coordination of the WAP with other funds and programs where possible and to streamline delivery of all low-income programs available in the state.

NYSERDA also administers several efficiency programs that assist low-income households and provides additional opportunities for subgrantees to leverage WAP funding. The additional services provided through these programs include electric reduction measures such as energy-efficient appliance replacement, lighting replacement and retrofits, electric domestic water heater measures, cooling usage reduction, energy-efficient motor replacement and retrofit, and energy education activities. While changes to these programs are anticipated as a result of the Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) proceeding, New York is committed to providing additional support to mitigate the impact of changing energy markets on low-income households.

KeySpan Gas East Corporation (KEDLI) collaborates with PSEG Long Island to share referrals for income eligible rate payers.  KEDLI also provides referrals for services to such entities as Suffolk County and Nassau County DSS HEAP, Suffolk County and Nassau County DSS Heating Equipment Clean & Tune, Margert Community Corporation, Long Island Housing Partnership, Inc. Economic Opportunity Council of Suffolk, Inc., NYSERDA’s EmPower New York, Community Development Corporation of Long Island, Inc., and United Way of Long Island’s Project Warmth as appropriate.

New York State has convened a low-income energy task force, comprised of state agencies responsible for administering key low-income energy programs (NYSERDA, NYS Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, NYS Department of Public Service, NYS Homes and Community Renewal).  The task force is directed to develop solutions for improving alignment and increasing impact of publicly funded low-income energy programs. 

NYSERDA and the DPS also administer the Low-Income Forum on Energy (LIFE), which provides an opportunity for stakeholders and service providers to engage and work to develop solutions for improving the delivery of service to income-eligible New Yorkers.

","In an order issued February 26, 2015 (REV Order), the Commission required Staff to work with the utilities and large industrial customers to develop Self-Direct Program Guidelines to be filed by August 3, 2015. The order also required electric utilities to implement a self-direct program in accordance with the Self-Direct Program Guidelines no later than January 1, 2017.

The Self-Direct Program is available to all individual customers with a 36-month average demand of 2 MW or greater. It is also available to customers with an aggregated 36-month average demand of 4 MW or greater, as long as one or more of the accounts being aggregated by the customer has at least a 36-month average demand of 1 MW. To be eligible to participate in the upcoming three-year cycle, current participants in the Self-Direct Program must have accessed 100% of any funds rolled over from the previous cycle, at least 45% of the funds from their ESA by September 30th of the third year of the current cycle, and have achieved savings at or below the dollar per MWh to which the participant committed at the time of enrollment.

The initial 3-year cycle for the Self-Direct programs ran from 2017 through 2019. Enrollment in the Self-Direct programs was generally minimal and, therefore, in a March 2018 order, the Commission allowed each utility to determine whether to continue to offer its large energy-user customers a Self-Direct Program.

","Following an April 2007 order (Cases 03-E-0640 and 06-G-0746), electric and gas utilities must file proposals for true-up-based decoupling mechanisms in ongoing and new rate cases. All six major electric and all 10 major gas companies have revenue decoupling mechanisms in place.

In 2008, the Commission established incentives for electric utility energy efficiency programs under the EEPS proceeding. Energy savings targets for initial program years 2009 through 2011 were combined to create a single target as of December 31, 2011. Beginning in 2012, savings targets will be annual. For the 2009 through 2011 incentive period, a utility earns incentives or incurs negative adjustments for its electric or gas EEPS portfolio based upon the extent to which it achieved its energy savings targets during the years 2009 through 2011. Maximum potential incentives/negative adjustments for each utility are calculated by multiplying $38.85/MWh for electric savings and $3.00/Dth for gas savings times the utility’s cumulative electric and gas energy savings targets for each portfolio. If a utility achieves over 80% of a portfolio’s energy savings target, it earns an incentive scaled linearly from 0% of the available incentive at an 80% achievement level up to 100% at a 100% achievement level. Portfolio performance of 70-80% neither earns an incentive nor incurs a negative adjustment. Negative adjustments are calculated in a symmetrical manner to the incentives calculation with the full negative adjustment imposed at the 50% achievement level and decreasing linearly to 0% at the 70% level.

In the 2012 through 2015 incentive period, the Commission established incentive pools totaling $36 million for electric utilities and $14 million for gas utilities, totaled over a four-year incentive period. The incentive program provides a two-tier incentive. Utilities will be eligible for incentives not only for achievement of their own targets, but also for the achievement of statewide goals. This is intended to encourage utilities to act in cooperation with NYSERDA, which administers programs in all utility territories to enhance achievement of its targets as well. The amount for which each utility is eligible will be based on its proportional share of the utilities’ aggregate targets by the end of 2015.

In 2014, New York initiated a proceeding, Case 14-M-0101, ""Reforming the Energy Vision,"" to examine the potential for major changes to the utility regulatory structure within the state.


In a November 16, 2017 order, the Commission awarded $56.5M and $12.4M of these shareholder incentives for the electric and gas portfolios, respectively, for the 2009-2015 EEPS energy efficiency programs.

The 2014 REV proceeding, in Case 14-M-0101, which led to the filing of ETIPs beginning in 2016, did not include EEPS-like incentives.  Rather, energy efficiency earning adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) are developed for each IOU separately during its rate case proceeding.


Beginning with Con Edison in 2016 (Case 16-E-0060), Earning adjustment mechanisms (EAMs) are being designed within a rate case to reward energy efficiency performance.  These EAMs have been established on a company specific basis as they have been part of the negotiated outcomes of the rate case proceedings.

","Connecticut’s energy reduction plan requires the state to reduce agency building energy use by establishing a baseline, identify high energy users, conducting audits, and implementing cost-effective energy efficiency measures. To comply with Connecticut law, buildings must demonstrate a 20% energy reduction goal no later than January 1, 2018. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) has implemented the successful “Lead by Example” (LBE) initiative (CGS §16a-37u). In April 2019, Governor Lamont expanded the program via Executive Order 1. Energy savings performance contracts, bond funds, and other financing have supported projects.

Since 2007, Connecticut has allocated $88 million for energy efficiency retrofits in state buildings, which includes $20 million just released this year. As of May 1, 2018, 61 projects have been completed under the LBE Bond funded program, for a total estimated annual cost reduction of $2.64 million, an estimated annual reduction of 85.9 billion BTUs, and an average simple payback of 8.7 years. To date, nearly $842,000 in utility incentives have been leveraged under the program. To date, 73 projects have been approved with an estimated annual energy consumption savings exceeding 99.1 billion BTUs. Once these projects are complete, the total estimated energy cost reduction is $2.91 million.

In December 2016, Connecticut launched its first state Energy Savings Performance Contract Project at the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services Connecticut Valley Hospital campus. This comprehensive campus-wide project will result in guaranteed energy and maintenance savings of $31.0 million over the 15-year performance period. Currently in the construction phase, it has already produced savings of 6,688mmBtu, over $68K, and 708 tons of greenhouse gas emissions.

High Performance State Buildings: In 2006, High Performance State Buildings were mandated through General Statutes Section 16a-38k-1 to 16a-38k-7, creating an above code building standard for all State-funded construction projects. In 2007, Governor M. Jodi Rell signed HB 7432, which broadened and increased the state's green buildings requirement. Starting January 1, 2008, no exemptions to the energy efficiency rules for state facilities exist, except to those state facilities where at least $2 million of the funding comes from the state. The bill also extended energy efficiency requirements to school renovations and construction where at least $2 million is provided in state funding. All of these facilities must exceed the current building code energy efficiency standards by at least 21%. In 2019, Connecticut expanded its High Performance Building Performance Standard to establish state building construction standards by January 1, 2020, that incorporate a nationally-recognized model for sustainable construction codes of high performance green buildings.

Benchmarking: In 2014, DEEP was required to benchmark energy and water consumption of state owned and operated non-residential/residential buildings with a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or greater using the U.S. EPA’s Energy Star Portfolio Manager. DEEP must make this data public (CGS §16a-37t). In addition, the gas and electric utilities are required to configure the most recent 36 months of nonresidential energy consumption data for uploading into EPA’s Energy Star Portfolio Manager (CSG §16-245ii). Subsequently, allowing the public to track state energy data. The electric utilities are sending energy consumption data electronically to DEEP, which represents the majority of energy accounts supplying state owned and leased buildings. To date, DEEP staff have benchmarked 42% of state buidings, or 100% of state government buildings that have participated in bond-funded programs, including 72 projects across 294 buildings or 66.9 million total square feet. In 2017 Connecticut purchased tool called EnergyCAP to assist with the state's Building Energy Evaluation System by enabling more precise and up-to-date benchmarking data. Additionally, Connecticut utilities have launched the Automated Data Transfer Project to benchmark municipal, board of education, houses of worship, and other local business buildings.

The Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) has recently formalized benchmarking assistance protocol with the formation of a “Benchmarking Help Desk,” which gives towns, state agencies and schools a resource for questions related to energy benchmarking and the use of ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. ISE provides one-on-one or group training on the use of Portfolio Manager for those interested in the upkeep of their portfolios, with personalized instruction based on the needs of the interested party. ISE has benchmarked over 900 buildings in Connecticut and has provided technical assistance to DEEP, the Technical High School System (CTHSS), the Board of Regents, St. Joseph's Residence - Enfield, the Alzheimer's Resource Center, Middlesex Community College, several towns, GT Green Leaf Schools, and over 100 municipal and state building managers enrolled in the GPRO courses. As a result of the benchmarking and engagement from ISE, CTHSS implemented LED lighting upgrades through the utility-run Small Business Energy Advantage Program and received a 2016 CT Green-Circle Sustainability Award for its energy saving successes.

Connecticut’s Small Business Energy Advantage Program (SBEA), one of the state’s LBE programs, targets small businesses, and state agencies. The program provides comprehensive energy- and cost-savings by means of a turnkey solution for customers who typically do not have in-house energy management resources. In 2016, 1800 projects had been completed under the SBEA program, for a total estimated annual cost reduction of $6.0 million, a lifetime cost reduction of $75.0 million, and a total estimated annual reduction of 42.7 million kWh (533.4 million LT kWh). In 2016, 20,640 tons of CO2 emissions were reduced as well. As of March 2018, 84 “electric” state agency projects had been completed under the SBEA program. The total estimated annual reduction is 4.6 million kWh, with an average payback on the net cost to state agencies of 3.37 years. Under this program, $1.8 million in electric CEEF incentives has been leveraged. To date, over 140 state agency SBEA projects have been approved with an estimated annual reduction of 7.0 million Kwh and $1million in cost reductions.

","Gap Analysis/Strategic Compliance Plan: A proposal to conduct third party plan review and site studies has been approved by DEEP in its 2013-2015 C&LM draft decision. The Department of Construction Services and a committee that engages the Office of Construction Services, DEEP, the utility representatives, the Institute for Sustainable Energy and Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) is charged with the development and oversight of this effort. This process, once adopted, will be repeated annually through 2017 to determine additional training needs of local code officials, licensed inspectors, building designers and the trades, as well as the annual compliance rate for that year.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: In 2018, NMR Group completed a code compliance study of single-family homes in Connecticut that were built at the end of the 2009 IECC cycle, including an assessment of gross potential savings available from increasing compliance with both the 2009 IECC and the 2012 IECC-CT (Link). The study also compares homes to the amended version of the 2012 IECC. The 2012 IECC-CT results represent minimum compliance rates (a floor) and maximum potential savings (a ceiling) as the homes used for this assessment were built prior to the adoption of the 2012 IECC-CT (under the 2009 IECC). In November 2015, DNV-GL submitted its C19-C&I Connecticut New Construction Baseline and Code Compliance Study to the Energy Efficiency Board. Compliance with energy efficiency code requirements for commercial and industrial new construction buildings permitted between 2010 and 2013 was estimated at 75% of the population. NMR has completed its 2016/2017 process evaluation of the Residential New Construction program.  As part of that study, NMR will conduct a baseline study.  Although these findings have not been reported to date, they will be provided in a separate report. Additionally, NEEP is currently conducting a residential energy code compliance study, which is expected to be released in 2019.
	Utility Involvement: Utilities are involved in strategic planning and coordination, and utility-sponsored training. Regulatory guidelines have been established requiring significant utility involvement in supporting building energy code compliance. The Connecticut General Statute (16-245m) requires the utilities to submit a three-year Conservation and Management Plan.  The plan describes the utilities efforts in building energy code compliance-which the Department approves. Once the Department approves the plan, the companies are required to abide to it.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: A committee that includes the Office of Construction Services, DEEP, the utility representatives, the Institute for Sustainable energy and Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) meets regularly to review progress on the Gap Analysis and the Strategic Compliance Plan. The State of Connecticut is cooperating with Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) to adopt and implement the 2009 IECC. NEEP has developed a set of resources and model policy to assist with implementation. NEEP is an active member of BCAP/OCEAN.
	Training/Outreach: The Department of Construction Services’ Office of Education and Data Management consistently offers energy code trainings. Recently the utilities have assumed responsibility for DEEP’s previous role of sponsoring code compliance training and outreach activities (GPRO and BOC training).  Please see the recent activities focused on these efforts below.
	Certification Requirements: Connecticut also requires building code officials to be licensed, including training and exams related to the ICC building codes. The Office of Education and Data Management (OEDM) performs all credentialing responsibilities - including training, testing and records maintenance - for the Office of the State Building Inspector (OSBI) and the Office of State Fire Marshal (OSFM).  As such, OEDM is responsible for training and accrediting Building Code Enforcement and Fire Officials, as well as providing code-related instruction to individuals in the allied trade and design professions.

",2.5 out of 3,"The state has pursued a variety of policies to encourage CHP development, including establishing interconnection standards and financing programs. Two new CHP systems came online in Connecticut in 2018.
","Policy: Connecticut General Statute § 16-243a

Description: Approved in 2007, Connecticut’s interconnection standard applies to distributed generation, including CHP, up to 20MW in size. This standard pertains to the two investor-owned utilities in the state, and separates distributed generation into three distinct tiers based upon system size. These tiers mirror those of FERC’s interconnection standards, upon which Connecticut’s standards are closely based.

Connecticut's guidelines include a standard interconnection agreement and application fees that vary by system type. However, they are stricter than FERC's standards and differ in several significant ways, including the requirement of an external disconnect switch and an interconnection transformer, the requirement for customers to indemnify their utility against ""all causes of action,"" and the requirement to maintain liability insurance in specified amounts based on the system's capacity.

","CHP in energy efficiency standards: Connecticut’s energy efficiency targets are administered as part of its Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), initiated in 1998 by Connecticut General Statute § 16-245a et seq. In 2005, the state expanded its RPS to include Class III resources such as energy efficiency and CHP, which are supposed to comprise 4% of the state’s total output. To qualify as a Class III resource, CHP must have a minimum operating efficiency of at least 50%.

In 2013, the statute was revised with the passage of H.B. 6360. Among other things, this bill makes CHP more competitive within the portfolio standard by eliminating utilities' conservation savings from the tier of resource applicable to CHP.

Last Updated: July 2018
","Incentives, grants, or financing:  A state loan program provides long-term financing options for the installation of customer-side distributed resources, including CHP systems larger than 50 kW.

Net metering: Connecticut’s net metering regulation is only applicable to renewable-powered systems up to 2MW in size.

Last Updated: July 2018
","Some additional supportive policies exist to encourage CHP in Connecticut. In 2011, the state established streamlined air permitting procedures that simplify the permitting process for some CHP systems. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) developed a permit-by-rule (PBR) that applies to CHP systems. The PBR, which expedites permit processing time that would otherwise take about six months, became effective in 2013.

With the passage of Public Act No. 12-148 in 2012, a Microgrid Grant and Loan Pilot Program was established to support local distributed energy generation at critical facilities in the state. The program considers applications requesting financial support for the development of microgrids that are powered by CHP and other renewable energy sources. The state also passed legislation in 2016 to expand the DEEP microgrid program funding for additional types of costs associated with microgrids. Grants and loans can now be used to cover costs associated with distributed generation infrastructure.

Renewable-fueled CHP systems are eligible within the Connecticut Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and can be used to meet the state’s renewable targets. Also, in 2015, the Connecticut General Assembly passed Public Act 15-152 extending the state's anaerobic digester pilot program by two years, until 2017. The program provides loans, grants, or PPAs for anaerobic digestion facilities to generate electricity and heat.

In 2017, Connecticut enacted law PA 17-144, which allows electric distribution companies to provide financial incentives for the installation of fuel cell-powered combined heat and power systems.

Connecticut CHP systems can also qualify for a discounted natural gas rate.

",12.5 out of 20,"Connecticut is a leading state in delivering nationally-recognized and award-winning energy efficiency programs to all customer sectors. In 1998, the state created a long-term funding mechanism and required electric utilities to provide energy efficiency programs. Since 2005, the natural gas utilities have also offered significant energy and cost-saving programs to customer sectors statewide.

The Connecticut Energy Efficiency Board’s (EEB) 15 appointed members are drawn from private and public entities and represent a cross section of energy consumers, including: residents, business, non-profits, communities, and municipalities. The EEB is responsible for approving the electric and natural gas distribution companies’ three-year plans. The state’s energy efficiency programs and services, which are marketed under the statewide brand—Energize ConnecticutSM, are provided by Eversource, United Illuminating, Connecticut Natural Gas, and Southern Connecticut Gas. The utilities administer the programs and utilize a robust, highly-skilled green workforce to implement them.

In 2007, the Connecticut legislature enacted Public Act 07-242, An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency, which called for the utilities to pursue “all cost-effective energy efficiency” as their first priority resource. Additionally, the Act required the utilities to establish new regulatory mechanisms, such as electric and natural gas decoupling. This legislation envisioned energy efficiency as the focal point for statewide energy policy. In 2011, Public Act 11-80, An Act Concerning the Establishment of the Department of Energy Environmental Protection and Planning for Connecticut’s Energy Future, created the Department of Energy & Environmental Protection (DEEP), laid the groundwork for pursuing all cost-effective energy efficiency, and required DEEP to prepare a Comprehensive Energy Strategy for Connecticut every three years. The latest Comprehensive Energy Strategy was released in 2018.

Connecticut’s 2019-2021 Conservation & Load Management Plan (2019-2021 Plan) is a $693 million investment in making Connecticut more energy efficient. This investment will result in significant energy and cost savings for customers, improved productivity in business operations, a healthier indoor environment for Connecticut residents and businesses, reduced air pollution emissions (e.g., nitrous and sulfur oxides, and carbon dioxide), and the development of a highly-skilled green workforce in the state. The 2019-2021 Plan will result in electric lifetime savings of 8.94 billion kilowatt-hours, natural gas lifetime savings of 29 billion cubic feet of natural gas, oil lifetime savings of 80.2 million gallons, propane lifetime savings of 16.2 million gallons of propane, and 120,000 kilowatts of peak demand reduction.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Connecticut’s electric distribution utilities, natural gas companies, and municipal electric utilities are required by Connecticut statutes to provide conservation and load management programs for all customer sectors. The current three-year plan (2019-2021 Plan) was reviewed and approved by DEEP and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). Per statutory requirements of Public Act 18-50, An Act Concerning Connecticut’s Energy Future and policy guidance, the 2019-2021 Plan’s primary goal is to “implement cost-effective energy conservation programs, demand management, and market transformation initiatives.”

The continuity of Connecticut’s success in delivering high-quality Residential and Commercial and Industrial (C&I) energy efficiency programs and services is directly attributable to the determined efforts of the state’s utilities, the EEB, DEEP, and a multitude of stakeholders. The 2019-2021 Plan covers years 20, 21, and 22 of electric conservation programs since the electric restructuring Public Act 98-28, An Act Concerning Energy Independence, was passed, and covers years 13, 14, and 15 of natural gas efficiency programs since the passage of Public Act 05-01, An Act Concerning Energy Independence.

The 2019-2021 Plan’s programs and initiatives are designed to maintain Connecticut’s leadership in energy efficiency and demand reduction programs. The programs and incentives are designed to reflect market trends, new federal regulations and policies, emerging technologies, and evaluation results of its current programs. These considerations lead Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs toward greater efficacy while driving energy savings, greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and increased economic benefits. The 2019-2021 Plan’s programs and initiatives are designed to deliver 1.6 annual MMBtu savings, or equivalent megawatt-hours, for all fuels combined by 2020.

Top 2019-2021 Plan priorities for Connecticut’s programs include supporting the strategic adoption of heat pump technologies, offering an ENERGY STAR® Retail Products Platform, shifting rebates upstream to distributors to drive energy efficiency in specific customer sectors, supporting Strategic Energy Management (SEM)/ISO 50001 and promoting a SEM cohort approach, introducing new recapitalization strategies for the Small Business Energy Advantage program to leverage energy efficiency funds with private capital, continuing to target C&I market segments to deliver tailored measures and custom approaches, and to evaluate and implement demand reduction strategies for residential and C&I customers.

In 2019, the three primary funding sources for Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs are: (1) a three-mill systems benefit charge on customer electric bills, (2) A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) less gross receipts tax (GRT) assessed on customer electric bills, and (3) contributions from natural gas customers (on firm rates) through the natural gas CAM. Starting in 2020, as directed by Public Act 18-50, the first two primary funding sources listed above will combine into one six-mill CAM for electric customers of Eversource and United Illuminating. Additional funding sources for the 2019-2021 Plan’s programs include the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a Northeast carbon trade system, and revenues from the Connecticut electric utilities’ participation in the Independent System Operator-New England’s Forward Capacity Market.

The Companies maintain a statewide Energy Efficiency Dashboard to provide customers with monthly-updated data regarding program performance, including metrics for the Companies’ Residential and C&I programs, as well as for residential financing programs.

","Prior to passage of Public Act 07-242, An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency, utilities were not required to submit integrated resource plans in Connecticut’s restructured utility markets. After passage of Public Act 07-242, electric distribution companies were required to review the state’s energy and capacity resource assessment, and to develop a comprehensive plan for the procurement of energy resources. The Act requires resource selection and procurement to be performed so as to minimize the costs and to maximize consumer benefits consistent with the state’s environmental goals. The distribution companies must consider a full array of supply and demand resources and submit annual assessments of energy and capacity requirements for the next three, five, and 10 years. Additionally, the utilities must submit plans to “eliminate growth in electric demand” and to achieve other demand-side and environmental objectives.

Public Act 11-80 requires that Connecticut’s energy needs “shall be met first through all available energy efficiency and demand reduction resources that are cost-effective, reliable, and feasible. Connecticut’s utilities prepare three-year plans for energy efficiency programs that establish annual budgets, energy-saving goals, and performance metrics. The utilities provide annual updates to these three-year plans to align energy efficiency programs that reflect market trends, new federal regulations and policies, emerging technologies, and evaluation results of its current programs.

","Summary: Requirement for acquisition of all cost-effective efficiency resources, equivalent to yearly incremental electricity savings targets of ~1.11% and natural gas savings of 0.59% through 2021. 

Established by Public Act 98-28, An Act Concerning Energy Independence, the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires that electricity providers and wholesale suppliers obtain 27% of their retail load from renewable energy and energy efficiency by 2020. In 2011, Public Act 11-80,  An Act Concerning the Establishment of the Department of Energy Environmental Protection and Planning for Connecticut’s Energy Future, created DEEP and laid the groundwork for pursuing all cost-effective energy efficiency across the state. Public Act 11-80 also required DEEP to issue a new and updated Comprehensive Energy Strategy plan for Connecticut every three years, which considers all energy needs of the state, including but not limited to: electricity, cooling, heating, and transportation. In February 2018,  DEEP issued the 2018 Comprehensive Energy Strategy to advance Connecticut's goal of creating a cheaper, cleaner, more reliable energy future for all the state's residents and businesses.

Through the 2019-2021 Conservation & Load Management Plan’s (2019-2021 Plan) energy efficiency programs, the utilities will help DEEP meet two strategies focused on energy efficiency in buildings: (1) ensure sustainable and equitable funding for efficiency, and (2) advance market transformation of the energy efficiency industry.  

For the 2019-2021 Plan, Connecticut’s utilities expect to achieve 843 annual GWH savings (1.11% of sales) and 2,073 annual MMcf savings (0.59% of sales), which is enough to power 100,000 homes for one year. These projected energy savings resulting from the 2019-2021 Plan’s programs shows how energy efficiency is a valuable resource for the state and will “flatten” electricity consumption in Connecticut over the next few years.

	Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test and the modified utility cost test
	
	
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost
	



In Connecticut, the Utility Cost Test (or Modified Utility Cost Test for electric programs that save fossil fuels) is considered to be the primary test. The Total Resource Cost Test is used as a secondary test to provide a broader perspective of program performance. In addition to these three B/C tests, the electric and natural gas distribution companies use nominal avoided costs and a nominal discount rate of 5.5% for all B/C testing (per prior DEEP feedback). These B/C tests are required for overall portfolio and total program level screening. An exception is made for low-income programs, for which the Total Resource Cost Test is used in order to account for benefits beyond what the Utility Cost Test considers.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Connecticut is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSEP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project. Further information on health and environmental benefits is available in ACEEE’s Overview of State Approaches to Account for Health and Environmental Benefits of Energy Efficiency.



Independent evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V) has been an integral component of Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs since their inception. Programs are evaluated on an ongoing basis through an independent process overseen and administered by the Energy Efficiency Board, per Public Act 11-80, An Act Concerning the Establishment of the Department of Energy Environmental Protection and Planning for Connecticut’s Energy Future. The Act established formal rules and procedures for evaluation and an Evaluation Rules and Roadmap. Statewide evaluations of energy efficiency programs are conducted.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Connecticut’s Home Energy Solutions (HES)-Income Eligible program delivers valuable energy efficiency services to low-income customers (60% of state median income). Through home performance assessment and direct install services, this energy solution helps reduce the energy costs burden for low-income customers. For the 2019-2021 Plan, the HES-Income Eligible program and its sister solution HES will serve as the primary drivers of the utilities’ support in helping the State of Connecticut meet its legislative goal of weatherizing 80% of Connecticut’s existing homes by 2030. This goal was established by Public Act 11-80, Section 33, An Act Concerning the Establishment of the Department of Energy Environmental Protection and Planning for Connecticut’s Energy Future.

Connecticut’s utilities are required to allocate their limited-income budgets in parity with the revenues that are expected to be collected from that sector. As part of their Performance Management Incentive (PMI) calculation, the electric and natural gas utilities are required to spend a percentage of the HES-Income Eligible program budget. Additionally, the HES-Income Eligible program has electric, natural gas, oil, and propane savings metrics that must be met prior to the utilities receiving their PMI.

Connecticut’s Department of Economic and Community Development manages the Energy Conservation Loan (ECL) program that assists low- and moderate-income households (based on the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s standard of 200% of area median income) in receiving zero/low-interest financing to make energy efficiency improvements. The HES-Income Eligible program also assists customers in remediating some health and safety issues that are barriers to energy efficiency, including: performing a clean, tune, and test of a home’s HVAC system, making furnace repairs, fixing gas (natural gas and propane) leaks on the customer side, and performing domestic hot water tune-ups. 

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Connecticut relies on the Total Resource Cost test as its primary test for the HES-Income Eligible program. Connecticut regulators have repeatedly approved non-cost-effective low-income programs; however, no explicit adjustments or exceptions to general cost-effectiveness rules are in place for the HES-Income Eligible program. More information regarding B/C testing of efficiency programs in Connecticut can be found in Chapter 5 of the 2019-2021 Plan.

Conn. Gen. Stat. §16-24a required DEEP to conduct a proceeding regarding the development of a Low Income Discount Rate (LIDR) for natural gas and electric customers. In July 2013, the Bureau of Energy and Technology Policy (BETP) conducted the ""Low Income Discount Rate Review"" and submitted its report to PURA with the following recommendation: ""currently available programs already provide benefits equal to, or greater than, the value of benefits low-income households would receive through a 10% low-income discount rate."" In November 2013, PURA accepted the recommendation and determined that the existing rate assistance and energy efficiency programs are more beneficial to Connecticut's low-income residents than replacing them with a low-income discount rate.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

For the 2019-2021 Plan, Connecticut’s utilities will continue their long-term partnership with the Community Action Agencies (CAAs) to assist in cost sharing for US Department of Energy-funded Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) projects. DEEP administers Connecticut WAP projects through one CAA administrator. The target market for WAP are single-family properties and it is designed to help income-eligible customers minimize their energy burden through retrofits and home improvement measures. The utilities cost share some energy efficiency measures for WAP projects, including: ductless heat pumps, domestic hot water measures, administrative fees, heating system replacements, insulation, LED bulbs and fixtures, and windows.

","Connecticut does not allow for large C&I customers to self-direct the funds they would have paid for energy efficiency, or to opt-out entirely.

Since 2011, Connecticut has managed a Behavioral-Based Strategies program for residential customers. The program’s objective is to make customers aware of how much energy they consume and to empower them to adopt energy-efficient technologies and behaviors. The program’s primary information channel to residential customers is a behavioral-based communication, printed or electronic, that details how much energy an individual customer consumes, how they compare to other customers, and what steps they can take to become more energy efficient. Since its inception, the program has had an opt-out option for customers who do not wish to participate.

","Public Act 07-242, An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency, required PURA to order the state’s electric and natural gas distribution companies to decouple distribution revenues from the volume of natural gas or electricity sales. In 2013, Public Act 13-298, An Act Concerning Implementation of Connecticut’s Comprehensive Energy Strategy and Various Revisions to the Energy Statutes, adopted the requirement (again) of decoupling for all electric distribution companies.

Currently, United Illuminating uses a full decoupling mechanism, adjusted annually (see Docket No. 08-07-04RE03 and 13-01-19). Public Act 13-298 approved lost-based revenue recovery via federally mandated congestion charges (FMCCs), absent decoupling for Eversource (f/k/a Connecticut Light & Power). In 2015, Eversource’s rate case was approved for full decoupling.  

Connecticut’s natural gas companies also recover lost-based revenues. Connecticut Natural Gas has been decoupled since 2014, and in the next LDC rate case, Eversource (f/k/a Yankee Gas Services) will also file for decoupling. Southern Connecticut Gas currently recovers lost margins as a component of the Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) that is designed to recover distribution revenues lost due to energy efficiency program activities (avoided usage).

For managing Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs and budgets, the electric and natural gas distribution companies earn an annual performance target incentive that is tied to program specific-oriented metrics, including but not limited to energy savings and net economic benefits. Performance management incentives are typically based on a percentage of energy efficiency program costs and this percentage varies dependent on if goals and/or targets are met or exceeded. For the 2019-2021 Plan, the utilities have a base target 4.5% performance management incentive at 100% of goal for all three program years. During the 2019-2021 Plan, the utilities also plan to introduce a MMBtu-based or a greenhouse gas emissions reductions-based metric for tracking purposes.

Under Gen. Stats. §16-245o(d) and Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies § 16-244h-4, energy use data will be released to third parties only after written approval of the customer. 

Provision of Energy Use Data

Per Public Act No. 11-80, Sec. 125 & 126, each electric distribution, electric, and gas company shall make records of the energy consumption data of all non-residential buildings, as well as aggregate town customer usage information and make available to the public, while preserving the confidentiality of individual customers. 

Energy Use Data Availability

Connecticut’s Energy Efficiency Dashboard was developed in 2013 as an online resource that provides users with “real-time” data (updated monthly) regarding the state’s energy efficiency programs, their performance, and metrics. The purpose of the of the Dashboard is to provide regulators, legislators, advisors, and the general pubic a snapshot report regarding how well Connecticut’s energy efficiency programs are operating. Additionally in 2013, Connecticut created a Clean Energy Communities Dashboard that tracks the energy consumption (electric and natural gas only) of households and businesses in all of Connecticut’s 169 towns and cities. The individual town pages also detail the participation of Connecticut’s households and businesses in energy efficiency programs, as well as Residential Rebates redeemed.

The design and implementation of digital Customer Engagement Platforms were completed by both Eversource, United Illuminating, Connecticut Natural Gas, and Southern Connecticut Gas during the 2016-2018 Conservation & Load Management Plan. Each of the utilities’ customer engagement platforms allow customers to utilize the US Department of Energy’s Green Button to download their electric usage data. Additionally, customers can manually input other fuel type data to calculate their entire energy usage data. This energy data is compiled by the utilities to provide targeted energy-saving opportunities and give insightful, personalized recommendations to customers.

By fiscal year 2016, energy consumption for all state facilities decreased 11.45% from a 2008 baseline. Through fiscal year 2018, facility-related energy usage (including electricity, natural gas, propane, fuel oil, etc.) was approximately 7% less than the 2008 baseline (does not include steam or chilled water usage). Rather than require state agencies to develop an energy plan, Maryland's Department of General Services (DGS) has started to instead focus on making specific data request for information to individual state agencies (e.g. building size in sq. ft., building age, and primary facility use) so that this information can be uploaded into Maryland's energy billing database. When coupled with existing energy billing data, this additional facility-specific information can be used to calculate energy use intensity (EUI) for specific buildings and campuses, which can then be used by DGS determine the biggest opportunities for improvement in State building stock. Governor Hogan issued an executive order setting a new energy efficiency goal in state buildings in June 2019. The new goal is a 10% improvement from the FY18 baseline by 2029.

As part of its High Performance Green Building Program, since 2008 Maryland has required all new fully State funded building projects, plus partially State funded K-12 schools and Community College buildings exceeding 7,500 gross square feet to meet LEED Silver requirements (see S.B. 208 and H.B. 376). This includes a requirement to perform at least 15% better than the current adopted version of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Maryland uses ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to benchmark; currently, approximately 3% of state building square footage has been submitted and received an ENERGY STAR score. The Maryland Department of General Services also tracks energy consumption and costs for 100% of State facilities in a publicly-available online database. The database has been used since 2008 and currently tracks over 15,000 active utility accounts and includes over 1.8 million utility bill records. The database tracks all commodities including electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, steam, chilled water, and water and sewer. Energy usage can be viewed by agency, location, commodity, meter, or account. Facility details including area (in square feet), service address, build date, and weather station data are also captured.

Maryland is currently benchmark buildings (with individual meters) with its EnergyCAP database, which integrates with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. The EnergyCAP database compiles data on all state-owned buildings and allows for comparison of the building stocks of different agencies.

Article - State Finance and Procurement §3–602.1 was amended during the 2014 session of the General Assembly to include compliance “with a nationally recognized and accepted green building code”. Following this, the Green Building Council adopted and amended the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) for the use of State agency buildings, who may now choose between LEED and the IgCC.

In addition, the Maryland Energy Administration also offers the voluntary Maryland Smart Energy Communities program, through which counties and local governments can voluntarily adopt at least two of three energy goals, one of which is an electricity-focused energy efficiency goal. Participating counties and local governments are required to develop an energy baseline, create an energy plan, and track progress. In return, participating Maryland Smart Energy Communities become eligible for grant funds that can be used to enable qualifying energy projects in their community.

Electricity savings generated from CHP systems are eligible to be counted toward the savings goals.

CHP resource acquisition programs: Utilities in Maryland are running CHP programs to fulfill their three-year plans (2018-2020) for meeting the savings target set by the EmPOWER Maryland Efficiency Act of 2008. Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) offers its Smart Energy Savers Program to nonresidential, industrial, commercial, government, institutional and nonprofit electric service customers, regardless of their gas and/or electricity supplier. Delmarva Power and Pepco offer their CHP programs to a similar customer base in their respective territories. Potomac Edison and Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative now also offer CHP programs. These utility-run CHP programs provide financial incentives to commercial and industrial customers that employ CHP to reduce their energy consumption and demand usage.

Incentives range from $425/kW to $575/kW per project, based on the size of the system and funding availability, capped at $500k per project. Up to $3.4M in available for this program in FY 2019. Incentives were also available for micro-CHP projects (60 kW or less) in some areas of the State at 50% of project costs, with a maximum of $75,000. CHP projects may also be eligible for other assistance through Maryland Energy Administration’s Lawton Loan Program or Maryland’s Clean Energy Capital program.

Net metering: Maryland’s net-metering law has been expanded several times since it was originally enacted in 1997. In their current form, the rules apply to all utilities -- investor-owned utilities (IOUs), electric cooperatives and municipal utilities. Residents, businesses, schools or government entities with systems that generate electricity using micro-CHP resources are eligible for net metering. The law permits outright ownership by the customer-generators as well as third-party ownership structures (e.g., leases and power purchase agreements).

More recent goals set by the PSC require utilities to ramp up savings by 0.2% per year to reach 2% incremental savings (Order No. 87082). In 2017, the legislature passed SB 184, which codified the 2% energy savings goal into law through 2023.

Utilities must file their energy efficiency program plans with the Public Service Commission, which then must approve the plans.

Beginning in 2016, electric utilities must ramp up programs to increase incremental savings by 0.2 percent, leveling out when savings reach 2% per year. Natural gas goals and limited income goals are currently being planned.

Electricity savings and demand reduction plans and cost recovery proposals were required to be filed with the PSC beginning on September 1, 2008 and every three years thereafter.

","Summary: Beginning in 2016 and through 2023, utilities must ramp up programs by 0.2% per year, leveling out at 2% incremental savings per year as a percent of 2016 weather-normalized gross retail sales and electricity losses.

The EmPOWER Maryland Energy Efficiency Act of 2008 directed the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) to require electric utilities in the state to provide energy efficiency services to its customers to achieve 10% of the 15% per-capita electricity use reduction goal by 2015 calculated against a 2007 baseline (Order 82344). The 15% goal is equivalent to approximately 8,303 GWh. Utility programs must also achieve a reduction in per capita peak demand of at least 5% by end of 2011, 10%  by 2013, and 15% by 2015.

The Maryland Energy Administration (MEA) and other public and private stakeholders, including the Department of Housing and Community Development (excluding weatherization programs funded through the EmPOWER Maryland surcharge) aimed toward achieving the remaining 5% of the overall 2015 electricity savings, although no specific legal requirement exists.

Legislative goals ended in 2015. The goals were essentially achieved by the participating utilities with final achievement rates of 99% for the energy savings (MWh) goal and 100% for the peak demand savings (MW) goal. On a per capita basis, the Maryland electric utilities and cooperatives as a whole met the 10% reduction goal for energy use, but did not meet the 15% demand reduction goal, with 11% and 8% achieved respectively.

The PSC issued new EmPOWER targets with Order 87082 in July 2015. The order requires utilities to ultimately achieve savings of 2% per year by ramping up incremental savings at a rate of 0.2% per year beginning in 2016. This commitment was renewed during the 2017 legislative session with the passage of Senate Bill (“SB”) 184 / House Bill (“HB”) 514, which codified Commission Order No. 87082 regarding post-2015 electric energy efficiency goals. Work groups were established by Order 87082 to determine natural gas goals and limited income goals. The proposals were filed in February 2018 and will be discussed at the semi-annual hearings in May 2018.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Maryland relies on both legislative mandates (SB 184) and regulatory orders (Orders in case numbers 9153-9157, Order 82869, and Order 87082). The order follows the legislation. Evaluations are administered by both the utilities and the Maryland Public Service Commission. Maryland has established formal rules and procedures for evaluation, which are stated in the Maryland Strategic Evaluation Plan. Evaluations are conducted statewide and for each of the utilities.

In Maryland, reported savings are evaluated by the utilities' EM&V contractor(s) and verified by the PSC's independent evaluator. EM&V is done on an annual basis and results are filed with the Commission between March/April for evaluation and between May/June for verification.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Maryland relies on the Total Resource Cost Test (TRC) and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test, with the exception of low-income programs which may be implemented without passing the TRC. Maryland’s TRC accounts for non-energy benefits of productivity, increased comfort, water savings, and alternative fuel benefits. Maryland also accounts for avoided air emission costs.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Maryland is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

In 2017, SB 184 continued the requirement for limited income energy efficiency programs started under the EmPOWER Act of 2008.

Order No. 87082, issued in July 2015, directed the Limited-Income Work Group to consider and develop a recommended post-2015 goal for the EmPOWER limited-income programs no later than February 1, 2016.

In February 2016, the Work Group released a summary report, but they did not come to a consensus on one recommendation. Rather, the report provided recommendations based upon agreement on certain points among various stakeholders, such as customer eligibility and overlaps between electric and natural gas utility service territories.

The plans identify the potential resources the utilities intend to use to meet consumer needs in future years. The plans include significant energy efficiency and conservation savings.

Minnesota continues to take actions to support energy efficiency as a resource. On May 19, 2010, the Minnesota 2009 Energy Policy Act was signed into law as Chapter 110. This was the outcome of the Omnibus Energy Policy Bill from the 2009 legislative session. The PUC summarized the energy efficiency section of the statute: Modifies the criteria the PUC can consider in setting incentives for energy conservation. Adds language that makes implementation of cost-effective conservation “a preferred choice” while taking into account the impact of conservation on earnings.

In addition, Article 12, Sec. 2 and 3 of H.F. 729, passed in 2013, explicitly declared energy efficiency a resource and clarified that the state energy policy goal of saving 1.5% of retail energy sales annually is a floor, not a ceiling.

","Summary: Electric and Natural Gas: 1.5% incremental savings each year beginning in 2010, adjustable to a minimum of 1% savings.

Minnesota investor-owned electric and gas utilities are subject to the energy savings requirements of the Next Generation Energy Act (NGEA), passed by the Minnesota Legislature in 2007 (Minnesota Statutes 2008 § 216B.241). Among its provisions, the Act set incremental energy-saving goals for utilities of 1.5% of retail sales annually, commencing with the first triennial plan period that began January 1, 2010. Of the 1.5%, the first 1% must be met with direct energy efficiency energy savings, or conservation improvements. This may include savings from efficiency measures installed at a utility’s own facilities. The NGEA also allows savings to be achieved indirectly through energy codes and appliance standards. Up to 0.5% may be met by efficiency enhancements to each utility’s generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.

All electric and natural gas utilities, including municipal utilities and co-operatives, must set energy efficiency spending goals based on a percentage of revenue. Prior to the Next Generation Energy Act going into effect fully in 2010, Minnesota utilities were required to spend a percentage of gross operating revenue (0.5% gas, 1.5% electric, 2% for Xcel Energy's electric utility) on energy efficiency programs rather than to achieve a set amount of energy savings. In practice, however, these minimum spending requirements are often irrelevant, as utilities must spend more than these minimum percentages to achieve the 1.5% EERS.

The NGEA allows a utility to request a lower target (based on historical experience, an energy conservation potential study, and other factors), but for investor-owned utilities that target can be no lower than 1% per year. Lower savings can also be justified if the Commissioner of Commerce determines that additional savings are not cost-effective to ratepayers, the utility, participants, and society. In 2009, the state legislature passed interim legislation to reduce the mandated level of savings during the first three years for natural gas utilities, establishing an interim average annual savings goal of 0.75% over 2010-2012 for utilities that submit a “ramp up” plan that averages annual savings of 1% in subsequent years (Minnesota Session Laws 2009, Ch. 110, Sec. 32).

However, the Division of Energy Resources and staff from Minnesota Department of Commerce also assists in the evaluation administration. Evaluations for each of the utilities are conducted. Minnesota has formal requirements for evaluation articulated in?MN Statutes 261B.241?and?Rule 7690.0550.

Minnesota Statute 216B.241 (Subdivision 7) requires both natural gas and electric utilities to provide low-income energy efficiency programs. Both municipal gas and electric utilities must spend at least 0.2% of their gross operating revenue from residential customers on low-income programs. Legislation passed in 2013 raised the minimum low-income spending requirement for investor-owned natural gas utilities from 0.2% to 0.4% of their most recent three-year average gross operating revenue from residential customers.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in MN Statutes 261B.241 and Rule 7690.0550. The benefit-cost tests are required for portfolio, total program, and customer project level screening with exceptions for low-income programs. Subd 7(e) of 216B.241 directs that “costs and benefits associated with any approved low-income gas or electric conservation improvement program that is not cost-effective when considering the costs and benefits to the utility may, at the discretion of the utility, be excluded from the calculation of net economic benefits for purposes of calculating the financial incentive to the utility. The energy and demand savings may, at the discretion of the utility, be applied toward the calculation of overall portfolio energy and demand savings for purposes of determining progress toward annual goals and in the financial incentive mechanism.”

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Minnesota Department of Commerce is responsible for administration of the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The department’s Division of Energy Resources includes not only WAP but also the State Energy Program (SEP), Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), as well as the Conservation Improvement Program (CIP), a statewide program funded by ratepayers to help Minnesota households and businesses use electricity and natural gas more efficiency. Close proximity of these programs within the department allows for coordination of services for low-income households. The Department of Commerce Energy Assistance Program (EAP) offers a simple one-stop shop for applying to EAP, WAP, and CIP.

APPRISE Incorporated recently completed a State-commissioned three-year study on the Low Income CIP. One of the primary objectives was to assess the current performance of the utility LI CIP programs and identify opportunities for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of those programs. Overall, the study found that the LI CIP is meeting or exceeding most of the statutory and regulatory requirements. The study also identified ways in which program performance could be enhanced through additional collaboration among the utilities to share program experiences, and between the Minnesota Department of Commerce and the utilities to consider the adoption of low-income program best practices.

Minnesota has had a shared benefit incentive in place since 1999. The incentive increases as the percentage of savings of retail sales increases. There is a cap of 20% of net benefits on the amount of incentive that may be earned. The incentive is set such that at savings of 1.5% of retail sales, electric utilities will earn an incentive of $0.07 per kWh saved, and gas utilities will earn and incentive of $9.00 per thousand cubic feet saved. The percentage of net benefits to be awarded to each utility at different energy savings levels will be set at the beginning of each year. (See Minn. Stat.§ 216B.241, subd. l(c) and Docket No. E,G-999/CI-08-133).

The PUC adopted an updated DSM benefit incentive mechanism for 2017-2019 with the following provisions: For electric utilities, the threshold is set for one percent of retail sales. For each energy savings increase of 0.1% of retail sales, net benefits awarded increase by 0.75% until reaching the net benefits cap at energy savings achievements equal to 1.7%. At savings of 1.7% and higher, the incentive provided equals the net benefit cap times the net benefits.

For gas, the threshold is set at 0.7% of retail sales. For each energy savings increase of 0.1% of retail sales, net benefits awarded increase 0.75% until reaching the established cap at energy savings achievements equal to 1.2%. At 1.2% savings and higher, incentives provided are equal to the net benefit cap times the net benefits.

Schools in Portland General Electric and Pacific Power territory also report their energy use to ODOE as part of the public purpose charge program (1999). The school district staff must gather information from their utility bills before audits can be performed on their schools and before entering Energy Usage Index information into the secure, online School Interactive Database. 

A 2017 Executive Order implemented new requirements for carbon neutral operation for new state buildings, statewide plug load strategy, energy efficiency equipment procurement requirement, and life cycle cost analysis. All existing state-owned buildings must undergo retrofits and remodels to meet high performance energy use targets based on ASHRAE Standard 100. In addition, state-owned buildings permitted after January 1, 2022, and used primarily as office or other commercial work space must operate as carbon-neutral buildings following ASHRAE standard 189.1. DAS and ODOE developed and are implementing a statewide plug-load management strategy to encourage occupant behavior changes to reduce energy uses not regulated by codes and standards. DAS, with support from ODOE, must ensure that all equipment purchased by the state meets high-efficiency energy and water use specifications by incorporating efficiency standards into procurement requirements. ODOE is currently developing analysis tools to analyze state building costs, including lifecycle energy and water use costs or savings, when considering energy and water measure upgrades for state buildings.

","The Oregon Department of Administrative Services (the agency responsible for managing Oregon’s public agency vehicle fleet) has set a specific target for a 10% increase in average fleet miles-per-gallon by 2020, from a 2007 baseline. This target is included as an official Key Performance Metric (KPM) in the agency's Annual Performance Progress Report. According to Oregon's 2018 progress report, the 2018 average fleet miles-per-gallon rose over the 2017 value and are on target to achieve the 10% increase over 2007 levels by 2020. There has been a 9.5% increase over the 18.73 MPG 2007 baseline.

Additionally, the Oregon Department of Administrative Service’s Statewide Fleet Management Policy (#107-009-040) discusses fleet efficiency in two sections:

Regarding the efficient and economical use of state vehicles, underutilized vehicles are subject to reassignment or sale, and high-efficiency vehicles are prioritized for high-usage scenarios, where their comparative efficiency produces the greatest gains. 
	For purchasing new vehicles, by 2025, a minimum of 25 percent of new light-duty state fleet purchases and leases for applicable uses, to the extent available, will be Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV). If not available, then Alternate-fuel or Hybrid vehicles meeting the U.S. Energy Policy Act (EPACT) requirements. If not available, then Low-Emission (LEV) II standard gas vehicles. If not available, then standard gas vehicles.
	Agencies must encourage adoption of ZEV’s and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by setting internal policies and processes such that, where a ZEV or LEV will work for state business travel needs, a ZEV or LEV will be the employee’s first choice. This applies to all state-owned vehicles, leased vehicles, or rental vehicles.
	Agencies will follow DAS and Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) recommendations for the purchase of the most economically feasible ZEV options. However, on a limited basis, agencies may invest in higher cost, newer types of ZEVs that may not have a favorable ROI in order to test emerging vehicle technologies.
	Wherever possible and economically feasible, agencies will replace Internal Combustion Engine vehicles with ZEV or LEV options.
While not efficiency-focused, the Oregon Department of Energy had been recognized for its alternative fuel efforts.

","Gap Analysis/Strategic Compliance Plan: The Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance conducts studies for the region, including Oregon-specific studies, to evaluate energy code-related progress, opportunities, and compliance. NEEA published a Market Progress Evaluation Report in February 2017 (in addition to recent compliance studies) to evaluate code efforts and affect implementation of the most recent commercial and residential energy codes. Oregon already experiences high code compliance based on other recent studies, but this study looked at other potential actions to improve state energy code implementation and development. This study looked at various code activities in the state, highlighted successful programs, and provided various opportunities for process and program improvement in Oregon to improve overall energy code implementation and compliance. NEEA, as well as other state organizations, can use this study to inform future near- and long-term actions to facilitate code implementation and compliance. 
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: NEEA completed a 2013 compliance study for the region. It includes recommendations to improve compliance, which Oregon is incorporating into training and process improvements. Design is underway for Commercial Compliance studies in the NEEA Region. NEEA’s study measured compliance on two scales and returned results of 91% and 96%, prescriptive pathway. For commercial energy code compliance, a pilot study to develop an appropriate methodology applicable to the region was completed by NEEA in April 2016. Throughout 2017, the design of a detailed Oregon-specific compliance study was developed by NEEA, with direct input from the Oregon Department of Energy and the Energy Trust of Oregon on data collection and sampling structure. The initial design phase is complete, and NEEA's contractor for this study is in the middle of initial implementation, recruitment, and detailed building audits/site visits to complete this detailed commercial code compliance study. Due to significant data collection requirements and in-field work, this study is fairly time-intensive and is expected to be completed at the end of 2018.
	Utility Involvement: Utility programs are encouraged by regulators via guidance to market transformation efforts to assist with quality assurance in new home programs. Oregon has a statewide building code, and the state provides training to and certification of building officials and enforcement where officials fail to enforce code. Utilities provide incentives for above code compliance and training of contractors and building owners (BPA utilities; IOUs through the Energy Trust of Oregon). Through NEEA, utilities directly support market transformation, training, and compliance with energy codes. Utility program implementers participate in code proposal development. Oregon's compliance rates are such that direct utility program intervention in jurisdictional quality control is not a need. However, NEEA, which is utility-funded, sponsors energy code training, development, compliance studies, and planning, in coordination with state agencies and other stakeholders. Energy savings from NEEA energy code programs are distributed/credited to the funding utilities. The Oregon PUC allows energy savings from code and code compliance to be included in utility IRP energy efficiency savings. The major investor-owned utility programs (gas and electric) are operated by the Energy Trust of Oregon, and the IOUs also support NEEA. The PUC and governing board oversight verify that programs support code compliance and work toward advancing codes.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: NEEA operates a regional code collaborative, with regularly scheduled meetings and cooperative deliverables to help align/compare codes in the region. Oregon also works closely with the Pacific Coast Collaborative (PCC) on codes and standards opportunities.  Also, the Construction Industry Energy Board (CIEB) is a Governor-appointed board in Oregon that
	includes stakeholders from other building code boards (Mechanical, Plumbing, Electrical, Residential, Structures, and the Oregon Department of Energy). The function of the CIEB is to facilitate state building code compliance related to energy efficiency, evaluate building code standards, and advise and provide recommendations to the state agency responsible for code administration (Department of Consumer and Business Services, Building Codes Division).
	Training/Outreach: ODOE operates a codes hotline for commercial and residential code compliance and proves a series of industry trainings each year. The Oregon Building Codes Division provides the primary outreach and training for all building officials. The Division provides mandatory code update training for code officials. In order to maintain their certification to work in Oregon, building officials must complete the code change training course. The Division also provides call support for the codes. Statewide Interpretation Requests can be issued should there be a code question, allowing for consistent code application in every jurisdiction. For the remainder of the market (contractors, builders, engineers, architects, etc), the Oregon Home Builders Association conducts outreach and training to homebuilders the Oregon Department of Energy provides training and a code hotline to builders, designers, industry and other stakeholders. OHBA and ODOE programs are supported by NEEA. Additionally, utility programs also support training and outreach for ""beyond code"" construction. Oregon has both residential and commercial code updates upcoming in the next year. In consideration of these updates, the Building Codes Division, Oregon Department of Energy, and NEEA will collaborate to provide a coordinated training effort to jurisdictions and industry to provide detail on new energy code developments.

",1.5 out of 3,"The state has an interconnection standard that applies to CHP and a policy in place to encourage energy savings from CHP to help reach the state's long terms savings goals. One new CHP system was installed in 2018.
","Policy: Oregon Public Utility Commission Order No. 07-319, Order No. 09-196

Description: Oregon has three separate interconnection standards and several interconnection standards particular to different utilities. One standard is for the interconnection of non-net metered small generator facilities up to 10MW, one is for non-net metered large generator facilities larger than 20MW, and one for net-metered systems. No specific technologies are identified as applicable for interconnection, and CHP is not precluded from interconnecting under any of the standards.

The interconnection standards for specific utilities were adopted in 2007 and delineate standards for systems up to 2MW in size for businesses, and 25 kW for all residential customers. The PGE and PacifiCorp standard delineates multiple levels, or tiers, of interconnection. Systems that are appropriately vetted and 25 kW or smaller can be interconnected under the first level without fee. The second and third levels of interconnection are generally correlated with greater degrees of scrutiny, possible application fees and longer application and approval processes.

",10.5 out of 20,"Oregon is a leading state in energy efficiency, with programs dating back to the 1980s. Oregon energy utilities were first required to offer residential weatherization assistance to their customers by the 1981 Residential Energy Conservation Act. In 1989, the Oregon Public Utility Commission’s (OPUC’s) Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) Order No. 89-507 required the utilities to consider energy efficiency as a resource when developing plans.

Oregon's 1999 restructuring law, SB 1149, established a public purpose charge to support electric energy efficiency, renewable energy, and low-income programs. The public purpose charge is equal to 3% of the total revenues collected by the utilities and provides about $60 million per year for the electric programs. 

The Energy Trust of Oregon (ETO), a nonprofit organization established by the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) in 2002, administers most of the statewide energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Portland General Electric implements revenue per customer. In its first ever long-range strategic plan, the Energy Trust of Oregon laid out energy savings goals between 2010 and 2014 of 256 average megawatts (2,242.6 GWh) of electricity and 22.5 million annual therms of natural gas. In its second long-range strategic plan, Energy Trust laid out energy savings goals for the years 2015 through 2019 of 240 average megawatts (2,102 GWh) and 24 million annual therms of natural gas. These goals include savings from market transformation programs.

NW Natural and Cascade Natural Gas adopted public purpose funding for natural gas energy efficiency programs and decoupling mechanisms in Order Nos. 02-634 and 06-191, respectively. Avista Utilities’ natural gas programs are funded through deferred accounts. Average expenditures for the natural gas programs are $10-$12 million per year. The ETO administers the majority of the statewide natural gas energy efficiency programs.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","The majority of Oregon's energy customers (73%) are located in investor-owned utility territory. These customers are served by energy efficiency programs administered by the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon (ETO). The ETO was created in association with electric utility restructuring to provide energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.

The state’s electric energy efficiency programs are required by legislation (SB 1149). Oregon's energy efficiency programs are also supported by strong regional organizations—the Bonneville Power Administration, the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, and the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. Some utility customers are served by ETO, while others are served by utilities directly. The ETO has achieved significant success in a short time. Since its creation in 2002, the organization has rapidly developed and implemented a comprehensive menu of programs and services for customer energy efficiency.

Oregon's public purpose charge (3% of the total revenues collected by the utilities from customer electric bills) provides roughly $60 million per year to support energy efficiency, renewable energy, and low-income programs in Oregon. This funding supports the Energy Trust of Oregon's electric programs as well as electric low-income programs provided by Oregon Housing and Community Services, a state agency. In 2007, SB 838 extended the public purpose charge through 2025. The ETO also receives funding from natural gas utilities (NW Natural and Cascade Natural Gas) to administer natural gas efficiency programs.

Self-direct options are available in Oregon. The Eugene Water and Electric Board offers a self-direct program in which customers receive contractual obligations to achieve a certain kilowatt-hour of savings annually based on the percentage of load a customer represents and the average conservation savings achieved by the industrial sector in prior years. Self-direct customers continue to pay the regular cost-recovery mechanism (CRM) of 5% but receive a monthly rate credit equal to conservation fee minus utility measurement and verification costs. Customers who fail to meet their goals must repay a proportional amount of the rate credit. Also the Oregon Department of Energy offers a self-direct option to customers with more than 1 MW. More information on large customer self-direct programs can be found in the ACEEE report, Follow the Leaders: Improving Large Customer Self-Direct Programs.

NPCC has identified energy efficiency and conservation as the priority resource for meeting load growth in the region and expects that this resource can address about 85% of all load growth through 2030.

Specific to the state, the Energy Trust of Oregon works on behalf of Oregon's investor-owned utilty ratepayers to specify the annual and long-term levels of cost-effective, energy efficiency that should be acquired as part of the integrated resource plan of each of these utilities' Oregon territory. (The utilities are PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Northwest Natural, Avista, and Cascade Natural Gas.) SB 1157 (2016) directs electric utilities to plan for and pursue all cost-effective energy efficiency. Per statute, rules and a grant agreement with the state Energy Trust is also accountable for securing those cost-effective energy savings annually through its programs,  activities and a coordinated partnership with the market transformation organization the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA). Additionally, energy efficiency resource acquisition is supplemented by the work of the Oregon Department of Energy and the comprehensive energy efficiency program it oversees for nearly all of the school districts in the state.

In its first ever long-range strategic plan, the Energy Trust of Oregon laid out energy savings goals between 2010 and 2014 of 256 average megawatts (2,242.6 GWh) of electricity and 22.5 million annual therms of natural gas. These goals include savings from NEEA programs. Electric targets were equivalent to 0.8% of 2009 electric sales in 2010, ramping up to 1% in 2013 and 2014. Natural gas targets ramped up from 0.2% of 2007 natural gas sales to 0.4% in 2014. 

In its second long-range strategic plan, Energy Trust laid out energy savings goals for the years 2015 through 2019 of 240 average megawatts (2,102 GWh) and 24 million annual therms of natural gas. These goals include savings from market transformation programs. Electric targets were set to an estimated 1.4% of electric sales forecasted for 2014 through 2019. Natural gas targets are set at approximately 0.4% of natural gas sales for the same five-year time period.

Annual goals for Energy Trust reflect an increment in their Strategic Plan goal. These annual goals are codified by the OPUC and then incorporated into each utilities’ Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), along with a 20-year forecast of achievable, technical energy efficiency potential. In this sense, Energy Trust’s IRP goals represent a minimum resource standard and energy efficiency savings supplied by Energy Trust function as a resource supplied each year to the utilities to meet their IRP goals. Goals include savings from NEEA programs.

	Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test 
	
	
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test  
	



The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Oregon relies on regulatory orders (Docket UM 551, Order 94-590). Evaluations are mainly administered by the Energy Trust of Oregon. Oregon has formal requirements for evaluation articulated in Docket UM 551, Order 94-590. Statewide evaluations are conducted.  




Oregon uses two of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the?California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost test (TRC) and the Utility Cost Test (UCT). According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Oregon specifies the TRC to be its primary test for decision making. The benefit-cost tests are required for total program and individual measure level screening, although exceptions can be made under certain circumstances, such as for low-income programs, pilots, and new technologies. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Docket UM 551, Order 94-590.?Oregon’s TRC test accounts for avoided costs of compliance with future emissions regulations. Oregon’s TRC also applies a 10% adder to give a cost advantage to energy efficiency over supply-side options, and also accounts for non-energy benefits through direct utility calculations in cases in which the value is quantifiable, such as water or operations and maintenance savings.  



Based on Oregon PUC DOCKET UM 551, ORDER 94-590, exceptions to the cost-effectiveness requirements are allowed if one of the following conditions are met: ? 



a. Produce significant non-quantifiable non-energy benefits;? 
b. Will lead to market transformation and reduced costs;? 
c. Are needed for consistency with other DSM programs in the region;? 
d. Will help to increase participation in a cost-effective program;? 
e. Cannot be changed frequently, and will be cost-effective during the period?the program is offered;? 
f. Are included in a pilot or research project; or? 
g. Are required by law or are consistent with Commission policy or direction? 



Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Oregon is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP). Further information on health and environmental benefits is available in ACEEE’s Overview of State Approaches to Account for Health and Environmental Benefits of Energy Efficiency.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Legislation (Senate Bill 1149) requiring electric industry restructuring for the state’s largest investor-owned utilities was signed into law in July 1999. The law establishes an annual expenditure by the utilities of 3% of their revenues to fund “Public Purposes,” including energy efficiency, development of new renewable energy, and low-income weatherization. Per the legislation, 13% of the public purpose charge would be allocated to low-income weatherization through the Energy Conservation Helping Oregonians (ECHO) program.
  Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Docket UM 551, Order 94-590, which lays out a number of situations where the PUC may make exceptions to the standard societal test calculation. Order 15-200, signed June 23, 2015, concerns Idaho Power Company’s request for cost-effective exceptions to its DSM programs. The commission adopted the recommendation of staff that cost-effectiveness requirements in Order 95-590 do not apply to low-income weatherization programs, such as the Weatherization Assistance for Qualified Customers Program (WAQC).

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Oregon Housing and Community Services Department (OHCS) is responsible for administering US DOE Weatherization Assistance Program funds. OHCS also administers other funds related to low-income weatherization, including LIHEAP, the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Low-Income Weatherization Program, the occasional Petroleum Violation Escrow Program (PVE) funds and SBC-funded Energy Conservation Helping Oregonians (ECHO) program, and any funds designated for low-income weatherization awarded to the state as a result of legal settlements.

","The self-direct option for the Public Purpose Charge is required for two of the three investor-owned utilities. This program is uniform statewide across all impacted utilities. One consumer-owned utility has chosen to design and run a self-direction program. Programs cover approximately 80% of the electric customers in Oregon. Eligible sites must demonstrate they were over 1 MW on average in the prior year (8,760,000 kWh) to enter and remain in the program. Participants in the three participating programs have the proposed projects technically reviewed by the Oregon Department of Energy. In two programs, the expenditures toward qualified projects are used as credit to offset future Public Purpose Charges. The credit is applied on-bill. In the third, the utility does a set-aside program in combination with credit toward future Public Purpose Charges. These funds are provided by check and/or on-bill. A technical review of claimed savings is conducted by the Oregon Department of Energy prior to construction of a project. A sampling of projects are reviewed for actual performance.

","Guidelines for Third Party Access

The Electric Company Transfer of Data rule requires utilities to transfer customer energy use data to the Energy Trust of Oregon. An electric company must file and maintain a tariff with the Commission that specifies the types of proprietary customer information, along with the prices, terms, conditions, and consent procedures associated with the transfer of such information to its competitive operations, electricity service suppliers, affiliates, and aggregators. 

PGE and Pacific Power make use of the Green Button data sharing platform for residential and small business customers. Also, Pacific Power provides automated energy usage data to multi-tenant building managers for use with ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. PGE provides interval meter data through Schedule 320 for large commercial and industrial customers. Pacific Power has historically made interval meter data available through Schedule 271. They called this service Energy Profiler. 

The only third party that regularly receives energy usage data is Energy Trust of Oregon. Energy Trust currently receives monthly data for all customers of PGE, Pacific Power, Northwest Natural, Cascade Natural Gas, and eventually Avista Natural Gas. Energy Trust is able to analyze this data for the purposes of program delivery but not general marketing. For other third parties to formally receive customer data, each individual customer must grant access via a signed release.

Requirements for Provision of Energy Data

Electric utilities are required by the Commission to ""provide access to detailed, real-time information on electricity use and costs to help customers manage use and costs and understand how to save"" (UM 1460, Order 12 158 (5/8/12) at 3).

This report describes the compliance of residential new construction in Washington State with respect to the revised state energy code: 2009 Washington State Energy Code (WSEC). The study team assessed compliance using two different approaches: 1) Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Checklist Method and, 2) Significant Item Method. The Checklist Method analyzed how well the studied homes complied with each of the 61 code identified process and efficiency requirements, while the Significant Item Method analyzed compliance based on measures that were considered to have only the most significant impact on energy use. The completed study of residential energy code compliance in Washington demonstrates compliance rates at 96 percent and 97 percent for the Checklist and Significant Items Methods respectively. In addition, the study team assessed the energy impacts of code compliance by using a building simulation model to compare the relative energy use of ""as-built"" homes to the energy use of homes built to meet the prescriptive code.

","Washington, as part of the four-state region served by the Bonneville Power Authority and the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, incorporates energy efficiency as a resource for planning and investment decisions. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council has approved its Seventh Power Plan on February 10, 2016. The plan calls for the region to acquire 1,400 average megawatts of energy efficiency by 2021; 3,000 average megawatts by 2026; and 4.300 average megawatts by 2035. The Council states: ""In more than 90 percent of future conditions, cost-effective efficiency met all electricity load growth through 2030 and in more than half of the futures all load growth for the next 20 years. It's not only the single largest contributor to meeting the region's future electricity needs; it's also the single largest source of new peaking capacity. If developed aggressively, in combination with past efficiency acquisition, the energy efficiency resource could approach the size of the region's hydroelectric system's firm energy output, adding to the Northwest's heritage of clean and affordable power.""

The Power Plan is a regional energy blueprint developed by the NWPCC that guides the region's largest electricity supplier, the federal Bonneville Power Administration. Under federal law, the Council revises the 20-year plan every five years. While Bonneville implements the plan, the plan also serves as a reference document for the region's electric utilities in their own planning.

Each investor-owned utility models energy efficiency as a resource along with supply-side resources within its integrated resource plan, in accordance with WAC 480-100-238 and WAC 480-90-238. These rules require that the plan identify ""the mix of energy supply resources and conservation that will meet current and future needs at the lowest reasonable cost to the utility and its ratepayers,"" where lowest reasonable cost means ""the lowest cost mix of resources determined through a detailed and consistent analysis of a wide range of commercially available sources. At a minimum, this analysis must consider resource cost, market-volatility risks, demand-side resource uncertainties, resource dispatch ability, resource effect on system operation, the risks imposed on ratepayers, public policies regarding resource preference adopted by Washington state or the federal government and the cost of risks associated with environmental effects including emissions of carbon dioxide.""

","Summary: Utilities set biennial targets to achieve all cost-effective electricity conservation. Electric: Targets average ~0.9% incremental electricity savings per year. Natural gas: HB 1257 (2019) establishes an all cost-effective EERS for natural gas. Specific targets are pending.

Washington voters approved ballot initiative 937, the Energy Independence Act, in November 2006, which set new renewable energy resource and conservation requirements for large electric utilities to meet. The law, codified in Chapter 19.285 RCW, had rules adopted for its implementation in 2007 and 2008 (WAC 480-109, WAC 194-37). The energy conservation section requires each qualifying utility (those with more than 25,000 customers in Washington) to “pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.” Seventeen utilities, both publicly-owned and investor-owned, currently meet the definition of qualifying utility.

The law requires utilities to use methodologies consistent with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s (NPCC) to determine their achievable ten-year cost-effective conservation potential and update that potential assessment every two years. Utilities also must establish a biennial acquisition target beginning in 2010-2011 and update that target every two years. If a utility does not meet its conservation goals, it must pay an administrative fine for each MWh of shortfall, starting at $50 and adjusting annually for inflation beginning in 2007.

HB 1257 (2019) establishes a natural gas conservation standard requiring each gas company to acquire all conservation measures that are available and cost-effective. Each company must establish an acquisition target every two years, with initial targets taking effect by 2022.

The Regional Technical Forum (RTF), a part of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, maintains a regional-deemed savings database and develops protocols for calculating savings from certain efficiency measures. The electric investor-owned utilities are required to use these savings values, unless they can demonstrate that a company-develop savings value is more appropriate than a regional value.?This allows the utilities flexibility to develop service territory-specific values or update values based on new information more frequently than the Regional Technical Forum.?The?RTF?continually updates the database. 



Evaluation of ratepayer-funded electric energy efficiency programs in Washington is required in the state administrative code?WAC 480-109-120(4) (v)?and relies on regulatory orders. Evaluations are conducted by the independent third-party consultants selected by the utilities. Each electric utility files, develops, and maintains an EM&V Framework as well as an EM&V Plan, which is filed with each Biennial Conservation Plan.  



Washington uses two of the benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC) and the Utility Cost Test (UCT). According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Washington specifies the TRC to be its primary test for decision making. The benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio and program-level screening. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in the?Energy Independence Act of 2006.?Information on the TRC is in the 2018 State Working Group TRC Methodology Matrix. Washington’s test accounts for avoided costs of compliance with emissions regulations and participant health benefits. Washington’s TRC may account for costs and benefits associated with safety, water, or other fuels.  



The Commission's Energy Independence Act rule (WAC 480-109) requires an independent third-party evaluation of biennial conservation savings to be included in each utility's biennial conservation report. Independent third-party evaluators are?selected by the utilities in consultation with their conservation advisory groups and Commission staff.? 



For natural gas, the Commission initiated a rulemaking procedure in July 2012 to address the cost-effectiveness of natural gas conservation portfolios in light of low natural gas prices and avoided costs (Docket UG-121207). The Commission issued a policy statement on natural gas conservation cost-effectiveness as a result of this proceeding. The policy statement identifies the Commission’s preference for the TRC as the primary cost-effectiveness test but allows natural gas utilities to request to use the UCT as the primary test where there are significant non-energy benefits that are known but unquantified, thus biasing the TRC against conservation. 



Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Washington is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP). Further information on health and environmental benefits is available in ACEEE’s Overview of State Approaches to Account for Health and Environmental Benefits of Energy Efficiency.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Washington specifies the total resource cost (TRC) test to be its primary test for decision making. The benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio and program-level screening. Per WAC 480-109-100, low-income weatherization is not included in the portfolio or sector-level cost effectiveness analysis. Companies may implement low-income programs that have a TRC ratio of 0.67 or above. The rules for benefit-cost tests are directed by the Energy Independence Act of 2006, codified in Chapter 194-37 WAC, which specifies that the TRC test include all non-energy impacts that a resource or measure may provide that can be quantified and monetized. Washington also applies an additional 10% benefit, consistent with the Northwest Power Act.

WAC 480-109-100(10)(a) allows utilities to fully fund low-income conservation measures that are determined to be cost-effective consistent with the procedures in the Weatherization Manual, as well as associated repairs, administrative costs, and health and safety improvements. However, in Docket UE-131723, signed March 12, 2015, the commission revised the rule language to allow, rather than require, utilities to pursue low-income conservation that is cost-effective consistent with the procedures of the Weatherization Manual. “In recognition that low-income conservation programs have significant non-energy benefits, we find it appropriate for utilities to maintain robust low-income conservation offerings despite the unique barriers these programs face.”

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

Washington State is investing $15 million from 2015 to 2017 to provide weatherization in all counties of the state through its Matchmaker program, which matches state dollars with utility and other programs’ investments in weatherization. This biennium $4.3 million is being reserved in Matchmaker for the new Weatherization Plus Health initiative, which combines energy- and cost-saving weatherization improvements in low-income homes with measures that reduce health risks and health costs for vulnerable families. It is targeted to improve the home environments for children and adults with asthma.

In addition, the state applies over $70,000 of DOE WAP funding toward cosponsoring the Energy Project with the Washington State Community Action Partnership (WSCAP). The Energy Project serves the entire Washington weatherization network and has served as a model leveraging project for other states. The Opportunity Council in Bellingham serves as the administrative agent under an agreement with the WSCAP. Over the 23 years of its operation, the Energy Project’s activities have resulted in approximately $188 million of additional funding for low-income households. The Energy Project works to advocate for energy program funding and program designs that help low-income households by providing technical assistance to local agencies, negotiating programs with local utilities in coordination with the affected agencies, educating decision makers, evaluating and reporting progress, and researching new approaches and best practices for providing service.

","Washington State allows utilities to develop self-direct options for industrial and commercial customers, but of the investor-owned utilities, only Puget Sound Energy has developed a program. Puget Sound Energy's self-direct program is only available to industrial or commercial customers on electric rate specific rate schedules. The self-direct program operates on a 4-year cycle comprised of two phases: non-competitive and competitive. During the non-competitive phase, customers have exclusive access to their energy efficiency funds, which are the funds collected over the 4-year period. When this phase closes, any unused funds are pooled together and competitively bid on by the members of the self-directed program. Customers receive payment in the form of a check once the project is complete and verified. Participating customers do not receive any rate relief when they complete energy efficiency investments. 100% of projects are pre- and post-verified by the utility. This includes review and revision of savings calculations by the utility to determine incentive levels. The program is included in the third party evaluation cycle like all other utility conservation programs. As of July 2019, 29 of 37 self-direct customers were receiving incentives. These customers represented 84.6% of the qualifying load.

","The proposed full decoupling mechanism in Avista's 2014 general rate case (Dockets UE-140188 and UG-140189) was approved by the Commission in November 2014. As part of decoupling, Avista committed to increasing acquisition of electric conservation savings by 5% above its Energy Independence Act (EIA) biennial conservation targets while the decoupling mechanism is in effect.

Similarly, Puget Sound Energy's full decoupling mechanism went into effect July 2014, accompanied with the commitment to increase the acquisition of electric conservation savings by 5% above its EIA biennial conservation target and increase the funding available for low-income conservation. Additionally, through its decoupling petition, PSE committed to pursuing natural gas market transformation, which led to the NEEA natural gas market transformation pilot.

Pacific Power and Light's decoupling mechanism went into effect September 2016 (Docket UE-152253). As part of decoupling, all electric investor owned utilities in Washington have now been committed to increasing acquisition of electric conservation savings by 5% above the Energy Independence Act (EIA) biennial conservation targets while the decoupling mechanism is in effect. 

Consumer-owned utilities, which serve more than half the state's electric load, are not subject to state regulation of retail rates and may adjust rates as they deem necessary, including to adjust for the effect of energy efficiency programs on retail revenue. No specific decoupling mechanism is required to achieve this outcome.

Electric investor-owned utilities may propose “positive incentives for an investor-owned utility to exceed the [biennial conservation] targets,” as allowed by RCW 19.285.060(4). No incentive mechanism is currently in place or proposed, however. Utilities can also be penalized if they fail to meet energy savings goals (RCW 19.285.060).

","In 2007 the Illinois legislature enacted Public Act 095-0559, which specifically addresses energy efficiency in state government. The law directs all executive branch state agencies to set a goal of reducing energy use by 10% within 10 years. Targets were expanded in April 2009, when Governor Quinn signed Executive Order 7 to better coordinate energy savings activities in State government. Executive Order No. 7 sets a goal of a 20% energy reduction by 2020 for state facilities.

Specifically, EO 7 directed the Department of Central Management Services to implement a program to increase energy efficiency, track and reduce energy usage, and improve energy procurement for all State-owned and State-leased facilities. To facilitate these actions, the executive order creates an ""Energy Efficiency Committee"" consisting of several agency heads from various departments (Dept of Central Management Services, Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, and Capital Development Board). The committee oversees state building energy audits, the implementation of subsequent recommendations, and the procurement of equipment/services designed to decrease energy consumption at State-owned and State-leased facilities. 

Public Act 96-0896 required the state to conduct a pilot study to benchmark and label selected state buildings for energy efficiency.  Eleven individual buildings and six campuses representing a range of building types were included in the study, which was completed February 2013. The State intends to benchmark all significant Executive Agency buildings, although it would be a small percentage of all public buildings. Flagship buildings (James R. Thompson Center, Michael A. Bilandic Building) and some template buildings (e.g. ISP district offices) have done benchmarking thus far. 

Illinois' Green Buildings Act (20 ILCS 3130) requires that all new state-funded construction or major renovation of buildings are to seek LEED, Green Globes, or similar green building certification. New buildings and renovation less than 10,000 square feet must follow the guidelines for the highest level of LEED (or equivalent standard) that is practical, though they do not have to actually seek certification. Buildings or renovations larger than 10,000 square feet must be LEED Silver (or two Green Globes) certified and must receive all of the LEED credits that have been deemed mandatory by the Capital Development Board. LEED Silver is required when the project is valued at 40% the replacement cost of the state government building.

This opened the door for inclusion of CHP as an allowable technology under the state EEPS program. The Illinois Commerce Commission recently issued its orders for State Energy Office’s and the investor owned utilities’ three-year Energy Efficiency Portfolio plans.

CHP qualifies as an energy efficiency resource, and some of the largest utilities in Illinois, incuding ComEd, and Nicor, now offer per-kWh CHP acquisition programs and incentives for CHP deployment. Details on ComEd’s CHP program can be found here. Details on Nicor’s program can be found here. Utilities must consider CHP within their IRPs. The established goals for ComEd were developed on a per-project basis, and the spending associated with acquiring those projects was approved as part of the company’s broader energy efficiency programming.

The legislation set an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) that began at 0.2% of electricity sales per year in 2008 and increases in steps up to 2.0% of sales per year by 2015.

In late 2016, Illinois passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill (SB 2814), raising overall utility energy efficiency targets to require ComEd and Ameren to achieve cumulative 21.5% and 16% reductions in energy use, respectively, by 2030.

Illinois established a natural gas EERS in 2009 with a goal of providing 8.6% cumulative savings by 2020. The state is pilot-testing a natural gas decoupling program. Illinois does not provide shareholder incentives tied to energy efficiency programs.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","Illinois passed legislation (SB 1592) in July 2007 that created a requirement for large-scale utility energy efficiency programs in Illinois. SB 1592 authorizes utilities to recover the costs for providing energy efficiency programs and directs utilities to design and implement cost-recovery tariffs. Funds from the tariffs cover both utility- and state-administered programs. There is a cost cap in place that limits program costs. In December 2016, SB 2814 raised this cap from 2% of customer rates to 3.5%, eventually increasing to 4% beginning in 2026. Illinois established a natural gas EERS in 2009 with a goal of providing 8.6% cumulative savings by 2020.

SB 2814 also removed energy efficiency programs previously administered by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the Illinois Power Agency and placed the programs solely with the Utilities.  The legislation also transitioned goals previously structured as first-year savings to goals related to longer-term cumulative persistent annual savings.  

The utilities also offer on-bill financing opportunities to their customers for energy efficiency measures.

Section 16-111.5B of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides for additional procurement on an annual basis of cost-effective electric energy efficiency programs (beyond those included in Section 8-103 programs and without the spending limitation included in Section 8-103) through Illinois energy and power procurements. Each large electric utility conducts an annual solicitation process for purposes of requesting proposals from third-party vendors. The statute provides that ""the Commission shall also approve the energy efficiency programs and measures included in the procurement plan, including the annual energy savings goal, if the Commission determines they fully capture the potential for all achievable cost-effective savings, to the extent practicable, and otherwise satisfy the requirements of Section 8-103 of this Act."" There has been a significant increase in utility expenditures on energy efficiency due to this statutory provision.

Section 8-408 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act provides for voluntary energy efficiency programs to be offered by a medium-sized utility that is not subject to the mandatory energy efficiency standards. After a review of the initial pilot plan, the Commission determined that the cost-effective programs should continue into the future.

","Illinois legislation (SB 1592) establishes a state policy that requires electric utilities to use cost-effective energy efficiency and demand-response measures to reduce direct and indirect costs to consumers. This can be accomplished by avoiding or delaying the need for new generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, as well as off-setting more expensive power purchases. Illinois is a ""restructured"" state—with distribution utilities purchasing power in competitive wholesale markets. Reduced customer demand thus affects purchase decisions and resource planning. Although there are no rules in place for integrated resource planning, the state does have a filing requirement for long-term utility plans.

The scope of energy efficiency activity in Illinois began a dramatic expansion in July 2007 when the state legislature passed the Illinois Power Agency Act (IPAA), which includes requirements for energy efficiency and demand-response programs. The IPAA establishes an EERS that sets incremental annual electric and natural gas savings targets based on the previous year’s consumption, beginning on June 1 of that year (see § 220 ILCS 5/8-103). The electric savings requirement began at 0.2% in 2008 and ramped up to a requirement of 2% annual savings in 2015 and thereafter. The natural gas goals began in 2012 with a 0.2% reduction from 2011 sales and ramp up to 1.5% annual savings by 2019 (see Public Act 96-0033). However, due to a 2.0% rate impact cap, regulators had approved lower targets with incremental electric savings targets varying by utility from about 0.5% to 0.7% per year.

Future Energy Jobs Bill (SB 2814) was enacted into law as Public Act 99-0906 in December 2016 with an effective date of June 1, 2017. The legislation requires ComEd to achieve a cumulative 21.5% reduction and Ameren to achieve a 16% reduction in energy use by 2030, and also requires $25 million per year to be spent on programs to help low-income homes become more efficient. Goals are measured as the change in cumulative savings that consider both newly acquired savings as well as lost savings due to previously administered measures reaching the end of their Expected Measure Life.

Some of the provisions of the Act include adding 220 ILCS 5/8-103B to the Public Utilities Act. This Section shifts responsibility of the DCEO-administered electric efficiency programs to the various utilities. Public Act 99-0906 also revises the gas utility statute (220 ILCS 5/8-104) and assigns the gas utilities the responsibilities that were previously assigned to DCEO as well. Public Act 99-0906 also increases the cost cap (previously 2.0%) to 3.5% for the first four years, 3.75% for the four years that begin in 2022, and 4% for the five years that begin on January 1, 2026. For January 1, 2031 and beyond there is no reference to a cost cap. The new Act also eliminates the provisions for energy efficiency procurement by the Illinois Power Agency.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In December 2016, the Illinois State Legislature passed the Future Energy Jobs Bill (SB 2814). The legislation directs utilities to implement low-income energy efficiency measures of no less than $25 million per year for electric utilities that serve more than 3 million retail customers in the state (ComEd), and no less than $8.35 million per year for electric utilities that serve less than 3 million but more than 500,000 retail customers in the state (Ameren).

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Section 8-103B (Energy Efficiency and Demand-Response Measures) of SB 2814 excludes low-income energy efficiency measures from the need to satisfy the total resource cost-effectiveness (TRC) test.

Coordination of Low-Income and WAP Services

The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) is responsible for administering the state’s allocation of DOE weatherization funds. In Illinois, the weatherization program is called the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP). IHWAP provides Illinois’ low-income residents with the labor and materials needed to weatherize their homes and is funded by three sources: DOE WAP funding, Low Income Home Energy Assistance Block Grant funds from the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the state’s Supplemental Low-Income Energy Assistance Fund (from the monthly Low-Income Energy Assistance Charge assessed by electric and gas utilities).

","In February 2008, North Shore Gas and Peoples Gas and Coke were both approved for four-year revenue-per-customer decoupling pilots. Monthly adjustments began in March 2008. To continue the program after four years, the utility was required to make a general rate filing in which the commission extends the program (cases 07-0241/07-0242 (consolidated) and 09-0166/09-0167 (consolidated)). In the 09-0166/09-0167 (consolidated) cases, the rider was approved on a permanent basis.

The Commission approved decoupling for Ameren for natural gas in December 2015 (Docket No. 15-0142).

The two largest electric utilities do not have an explicit decoupling rider for energy efficiency purposes. However, as part of the AMI installation process, these utilities are using formula rates that adjust every year based on actual costs and actual sales in the previous years. The formula rate is in effect until December 31, 2022 per 220 ILCS 5/16-108.5.

Illinois Public Act 99-0906 was passed in December 2016, including a mechanism for electric utility shareholder incentives for energy efficiency. The legislation provides either increased ROI or decreased ROI to electric utilities based on their performance relative to statutory goals. This goes into effect on January 1, 2018.

","Guidelines for Third Party Access

The Commission has established guidelines and regulations for alternative retail electric supplier access in Docket Nos. 13-0506 (aggregated, anonymous data), 14-0701  (access to individual data by retail electric suppliers), Docket No. 15-7003 (access to individual data by entities other than retail electric suppliers), and 14-0507 (Data Access Framework Docket). See also Section 16-122 of the Illinois Public Utilities Act. 

For Green Button Connect, third parties  must accept and comply with the rules and standards of the national Green Button program and the Green Button Alliance and they must be in good standing with the state in which they are incorporated.

Requirements for Provision of Energy Data

Illinois requires the provision of individual meter energy data to customers, in a common electronic format, and to third parties upon authorization of the customer. Currently, alternative retail electric suppliers are able to access data through a secure electronic system. 

Illinois does not require the provision of energy use data in aggregated form to owners of multi-tenant buildings or to public agencies. 

 

While not required by statute or Commission Order, ComEd provides anonymous individual customer data in aggregated form through the Energy Usage Data System (EUDS), a web-based tool.  It enables an electronic link to the U.S. EPA’s building energy benchmarking system known as Portfolio Manager.  Another example is ComEd's Anonymous Data Service.  Customer-level interval usage data is assembled for all customers (by customer delivery class) in a five digit zip code. Specific retail customer identifiers, including but not limited to name, address, and electric account number, are omitted from the assembled data.

 

Energy Use Data Availability

In 2017, the Commission ordered utilities to consider the Open Data Access Framework as they design new AMI-based data services. 

There are no statewide standards for access to aggregated energy use data. The provision of aggregated usage data is described in Docket No. 13-0506. The Commission adopted a 15/15 Rule when a utility releases an anonymized, compiled data set of individual customer usage. It means that a utility is allowed to provide customer usage data when there are at least 15 customers (within a delivery class) within the same geographic area and a single customer’s load must not comprise more than 15% of the customer group's total load.  Docket No. 13-0506, Final Order at 17.

","Public Act 295 renewed and revised the state's commitment to energy efficiency in public buildings. In the area of state government energy efficiency, P.A. 295 sets a goal of reducing state government grid-based energy purchases 25% by 2015, from a 2002 baseline. The law directs the Department of Management and Budget (DMB), in consultation with the state Energy Office, to perform and oversee a number of tasks related to achieving this goal, including the establishment of an energy analysis program to evaluate each building owned or leased by the state at least every five years, as well as an assessment of the costs and benefits of using the LEED standard when constructing or renovating state buildings.

Executive Directive 2007-22 requires that all state buildings occupied by state employees be benchmarked using the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager tool. To date, over 1,000 of the State of Michigan's 6,000 leased or owned buildings have been benchmarked. The Governor has also recently tasked the state energy office, Michigan Public Service Commission, and Department of Technology, Management & Budget to develop a plan to benchmark state-owned buildings. This project is expected to encompass approximately 1,100 buildings and is actively underway.

The Michigan Agency for Energy offered grants to benchmark public buildings including schools, local government buildings, houses of workshops, etc. It is estimated that about 400+ buildings and 30.5 million sq. ft. will be benchmarked under this grant program. Under the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget project 35.5 million square feet has been benchmarked in Portfolio Manager. 

The State Energy Office also offers low-cost services to public building owners and others to determine energy savings opportunities. Services include energy audits, Energy Star Portfolio Manager account setup and a project planning meeting to discuss project financing and implementation.

",14 out of 20,"Michigan had a history of fairly aggressive energy efficiency programs until 1995, when demand-side management and integrated resource planning were discontinued during the move toward electric restructuring. Michigan had essentially no utility-sector energy efficiency programs from 1996 to 2008.

Public Act 295 of 2008 (enrolled SB 213) brought energy efficiency programs back to Michigan in the form of an EERS that requires all electric providers (other than alternative electric suppliers) and all rate-regulated natural gas utilities to file energy waste reduction programs with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC or Commission). Public Act 295 offers multiple options for providers of energy efficiency program administration, including administration by the provider, joint administration with other providers, administration by a state agency, or administration by a competitively-selected nonprofit organization.

PA 341 and PA 342, passed in December 2016, carries forward current 1% electric and 0.75% natural gas efficiency targets. The legislation also removes a cap on spending and allows for higher financial performance incentives for exceeding mandated 1% targets.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Legislation passed in October 2008, Public Act 295, reestablished utility energy efficiency programs in Michigan. The state's previous programs had been discontinued in 1996. Public Act 295 gave the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) the authority to approve or reject efficiency plan proposals. To approve a plan, the MPSC must determine that the plan meets the utility system resource cost test and is reasonable and prudent. In December 2016, the legislature passed PA 341/PA 342, carrying current 1% electric and 0.75% natural gas targets forward.

Utilities must offer programs to customers in all sectors (residential, low-income, commercial, and industrial). Eligible large electric customers can design and implement an energy efficiency plan for their own facilities and, if approved by their utilities, be exempt from paying the per-meter surcharge. The utilities may administer the programs themselves, administer the programs jointly with other providers, select a nonprofit to administer the programs, or opt to work with the MPSC-selected program administrator (the Independent Energy Waste Reduction Program Administrator).

Energy efficiency programs are supported by customer rates via a volumetric charge for residential customers and monthly ""per meter"" charges for commercial and industrial customers. Each utility specifies these charges in plans that are filed with the MPSC. To the extent feasible, the utilities must use the charges collected from each customer rate class to fund efficiency programs for that rate class. Utilities use customer rate classes to attribute costs to different categories of customers based on how those customers incur costs.

PA 295 had capped spending for each utility at 0.75% of total sales revenues in 2009, rising to 2.0% in 2012 and each year thereafter. However this cap was removed, effective April 2017, in the PA 341/PA 342 legislation package.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Under Act 295, an objective of the energy waste reduction programs is to reduce long-term costs to utility ratepayers—in particular, by delaying the need for additional power plants. A companion bill that passed at the same time (HB5524) incorporates energy efficiency into the integrated resource planning process. The MPSC has the authority to approve or reject the plans. Any utility seeking a “certificate of necessity” for a new power plant, transmission project, or major power purchase must have demonstrated the need for the capacity addition through an approved integrated resource plan.

In December 2016, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive energy bill package (PA 341/PA 342) extending energy savings targets. PA 341 (Section 6t) also enacted a new integrated resource plan (IRP) assessment process. The IRP will serve as the utilities’ short-, medium-, and long-range supply-side and demand-side energy capacity planning process. The Michigan Public Service Commission kicked off stakeholder discussions in March 2017 to initiate the IRP assessment process.

","Summary: Electric: 1% annual incremental savings. Natural Gas: 0.75% annual incremental savings. Targets terminate in 2021 for non-rate regulated utilities, representing approximately 10% of Michigan's electric load.

Michigan adopted an EERS in October 2008, when the Clean, Renewable, and Efficient Energy Act was signed into law, requiring all electric and natural gas utilities to provide energy waste reduction programs. PA 295 required electric utilities to achieve 0.3% savings in 2009; 0.5% in 2010; 0.75% in 2011; and 1.0% in each year from 2012 to 2015. Targets continued each year thereafter at 1% incremental electricity savings relative to the prior year’s total retail electricity sales. Targets for natural gas utilities started in 2009 at 0.1% savings as a percent of annual retail natural gas sales, eventually ramping up to 0.75% in each year from 2012 to 2015. PA 342, passed in December 2016, maintains the 1.0% (electric) and 0.75% (gas) targets in perpetuity for most utilities, except for non-rate regulated utilities for which targets extend through 2021. An earlier 2% spending cap for electric and natural gas utilities was also removed by the legislation.

Each MWh of savings achieved by a utility in a given year qualifies for one energy waste reduction credit. Excess credits can be ""banked"", i.e., can be used to meet up to one-third of the required energy savings in the year following the year in which they were achieved. Excess credits cannot be banked if a utility has opted to receive incentive payments for exceeding its savings targets in a particular year.

Regulated investor-owned utilities are responsible for 88.9% of the statewide electric savings targets; municipal utilities represent 7.8% of savings; and electric cooperatives, 3.4%. Most efficiency programs are administered by the utilities, although some have opted to fund a state-selected program administrator, Efficiency United, through an alternative compliance payment mechanism specified in Act 295. Although Efficiency United program services are not subject to the statutory savings targets, equivalent contractual targets were imposed by the Commission. Large electric customers, as determined by their peak use, may administer their own programs.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

SB 438, approved in December 2016, carried forward the state’s 1% annual energy savings requirement for utilities. The bill does not specify a minimum required level of spending or savings for low-income energy efficiency programs, other than to direct that distribution customers’ funding responsibilities for low-income residential programs be proportionate to the distribution customers’ funding of the total energy waste reduction program: “The established funding level for low-income residential programs shall be provided from each customer rate class in proportion to that customer rate class’s funding” of total energy efficiency programs.

Through a contested case process, utilities which are elegible to receive an incentive payment based on performance, have low income program goals.  Some are based on lifetime savings and some are based on increased spending.  DTE Energy and Consumers Energy also have a seperate metric that assesses additional multi-family housing upgrades.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Sec. 71 (4)(g) of SB 438 appears to exempt low-income programs from demonstrating cost-effectiveness. To demonstrate that the provider’s energy waste reduction programs, excluding program offerings to low-income residential customers, will collectively be cost effective, SB 438 states: “An energy waste reduction plan shall…demonstrate that the provider’s energy waste reduction programs, excluding program offerings to low-income residential customers, will collectively be cost-effective.”

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Bureau of Community Action and Economic Opportunity (BCAEO) within the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is responsible for administration of the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) for the state and for overseeing activities of Michigan Community Action Agencies (CAAs). The CAAs, utilities, and other agencies coordinate at the local level with utility EO programs directly supplementing WAP to streamline efforts and leverage available funding.

MPSC staff, stakeholders and the utilitiess reached a settlement on plan filings for programs beginning in 2018, which included additional incentive payment percentages based on increased low income programming. MPSC staff meet monthly with low income advocates including other state departments, advocacy groups, housing developers, and utilities to coordinate low-income energy-efficiency resources.

Michigan also distributes funds through the Michigan Energy Assistance Program, which are grants to non-profit organizations who assist the low income with bill payment. Many utilities coordinate their energy efficiency programs with these organizations to further assist low-income households with their home energy needs.

Previously, Act 295 had been the relevant decoupling legislation. Act 295 mandated that the Commission consider decoupling mechanisms proposed by the state's electric utilities. Consumers Energy and Detroit Edison had decoupling in place (U-15768 and U-15751), but Commission orders on electric utilities were overturned in court on basis of lack of statutory authority (See Michigan Court of Appeals Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity v.

Natural gas decoupling was not overturned in the 2012 court case above.

For the period 2017 through 2021, Act 342 allows for a provider to collect a financial performance incentive of up to 20% of program spending if that provider achieves 50% more than the mandated energy savings target. It is a sliding scale from 100% of target up to 150%, and the incentive level spreads from 15% to 20% of program spending.

The Commission approved performance incentives for DTE-Electric and DTE-Gas for program years 2009 through 2013 (U-16358, U-16359, U-16737, U-17282, U-17602, U-16289, U-16290, U-16751, U-17288, U-17608). The Commission has also approved performance incentives for Consumers Energy for program years 2009 through 2013 (U-16302, U-16303, U-16736, U-17281, U-17601). The Commission also approved a performance incentive for SEMCO Gas (U-17362) and Indiana Michigan Power Company (U-17353) for program years 2014 and 2015.

PA 295 (2008) contained two provisions whereby utilities could receive an economic incentive for implementing energy efficiency programs. First, they were allowed to request that energy efficiency program costs be capitalized and earn a normal rate of return. Second, they were allowed to request a performance incentive for shareholders if the utilities exceed the annual energy savings target. Performance incentives could not exceed 15% of the total cost of the energy efficiency programs nor 25% of net benefits. The Commission had approved performance incentives for DTE - Electric and Gas (U-17352, U-17358), and Consumers Energy (U-17351). The Commission also approved a performance incentive for SEMCO gas (U-17362). The Commission approved a performance incentive for Indiana Michigan Power Company (U-17353).

In November 2017, the MPSC updated its administrative rules pertaining to data privacy and data accessibility (R 460.101-460.169). These rules took effect in December 2017 and call for utilities to have in place data privacy procedures that assure customers that their personal information will not be distributed to third parties without a customer's knowledge or consent.

R 460.153 calls for all regulated utilities to submit a data privacy policy in the form of a tariff to the Commission. Per R 460.153 (g) the policy must provide clear instructions regarding the method by which a customer and a third party (authorized by the customer) may obtain customer usage data in a timely manner and in a readily accessible format. Order U-18485-0002 in Case No. U-18485 directs regulated utilities to comply with R 460.153 administrative rules by June 8, 2018. .  The Commission’s response to the filed data privacy tariffs will be provided in this docket following the June 8 filing deadline.

As of March 2018,  Michigan's two largest IOUs have already filed data privacy tariffs per earlier Commission order in Docket U-17102, but are expected to file amended data privacy tariffs in response to the new administrative rules.

","Executive Order D0011 07 (""Greening of State Government""), signed in 2007, charged State departments, agencies and offices to take a position of leadership in the by reducing state energy consumption. Specifically, the order set a goal that by fiscal year 2011-2012, state government achieve at least a 20 percent reduction in energy consumption of state facilities below fiscal year 2005-2006 levels. Executive Order D 2015-013, signed in 2015, renews this goal and requires all state agencies and departments to reduce energy consumption per square foot by 2% annually and at least 12% by FY 2020, from a baseline of FY 2015. State agencies and departments are further directed to achieve an absolute reduction of energy consumption by 5% over the same time period. As part of the executive order, all agencies are required to use EnergyCAP, a utility management software, to monitor and manage utility use and costs. In addition, on an annual basis, each agency shall develop an energy management plan outlining progress from the previous year and setting out strategies to achieve the energy reduction goal for the upcoming year. This EO establishes a new Greening Government Leadership Council, tasked with supporting efforts to make government operations more sustainable. The Council consists of one representative from every state agency.

Executive Order D 005-05, signed in July 2005, requires all state government agencies and departments to adopt the LEED rating system for existing and new buildings to ensure reductions in energy use to the extent practical and cost effective. The executive order also requires an energy management program within state agencies to monitor and manage utility use and costs. Executive Order D2010-006 expanded this requirement, calling for all state buildings to track energy use, with the exception of higher-educational buildings due to their unique relationship with the state. Under this directive, agencies must provide details from tracking energy and water consumption to paper usage and reduction. K-12 schools are now subject to very high efficiency standards after the passage of SB 13-279 in 2013. The goal of this school efficiency bill is to create resource-efficient schools, which use 33% less energy and 32% less water that their conventional counterparts. 

Clean Energy Economy for the Region (CLEER) supports the tracking of energy use in public buildings through its Active Energy Management Program. The program has helped schools and public buildings save 10-30% of their energy use without retrofits. CLEER has assisted over 80 public buildings in western Colorado to track and manage their energy use.

The State of Colorado is in the process of setting one and five year goals in numerous areas including energy and water efficiency, petroleum reduction, environmentally preferable purchasing, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The State is also developing directives for agencies and departments that ensure successful achievement of the goals. These include the requirement that all agencies prepare annual energy and water management plans and that energy performance contracting feasibility studies be performed for all state-owned buildings.

Colorado's High Performance Certification Program (HPCP) requires that buildings funded with state moneys or with moneys guaranteed or insured by the state where such moneys constitute at least 25 percent of the project cost achieve the highest performance certification attainable as certified by an independent third party pursuant to the high performance standard certification program. Colorado's Office of State Architect has approved the use of three different programs under this policy: U.S. Green Building Council, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design New Construction (USGBC LEED-NC) guideline with ""Gold"" as the targeted certification level; the Green Building Initiative (GBI), Green Globes guideline with ""Three Globes"" as the targeted certification level; and for the Colorado Department of Education, K-12 construction, the Collaborative for High Performance Schools (US-CHPS) is an optional guideline with ""Verified Leader"" as the targeted certification level.

Focus areas of the plan included: securing funding, promoting state and local policy, implementing outreach and training, and conducting compliance evaluation. Colorado continues to use this plan as a framework for addressing energy code adoption and compliance in Colorado.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: Baseline Compliance Study: In 2013, Colorado completed a statewide evaluation of energy code compliance. It found a rate of more than 90% compliance for residential construction, noting that more work could be done with HVAC systems. It also found that compliance with commercial codes was only 28%. In 2016, Colorado completed a commercial code compliance study to assess compliance for 2009 IECC. The Department of Energy requested that Colorado conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis to determine energy saved by complying with the code, as well as energy not saved due to non-compliance. Colorado received feedback from code officials and plan examiners noting that the commercial code is complex and time intensive. As a result, Colorado developed a simple methodology that looks at how buildings use energy and identified the top 15 code requirements that focus on high impact energy uses. Colorado is now administering trainings to jurisdictions and code officials on how to use this top 15 compliance checklist for the most effective use of time and effort.
	Utility Involvement: Xcel Energy will provide $50,000 per calendar year in 2019 and 2020 to support code trainings within its electric and natural gas service territories.

Both Xcel Energ, and Black Hills Energy have expanded their demand-side management (DSM) programs in recent years. The utilities file DSM plans annually, and are working toward the most recent EERS targets which have ramped up to 1.68% in 2020. 

HB 1227, signed in June 2017, extends electric efficiency programs to 2028 and requires the commission to set goals of at least 5% peak demand reduction and 5% energy savings by 2028 for demand-side management programs implemented during 2019 through 2028 when compared to a 2018 baseline. There is no decoupling for electric or gas utilities. In 2018, the Commission ruled that, given its new savings goal, PSCo will begin to receive a performance incentive only upon reaching 80% of the goal, or at 400 GWh. There will be a disincentive offset of $3M that PSCo will earn in two installments; the first $1.5M will be given once PSCo reaches 400 GWh of savings (80% of goal), and the second $1.5M will be given when the company reaches 450 GWh of savings (90% of goal). Total incentives are capped at $18M. Colorado implemented natural gas programs in 2008.

The Colorado legislature passed HB-07-1037 in April 2007, which amended Colorado statutes C.R.S. 40-1-102 and 40-3.2-101-105 by requiring the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (COPUC) to establish energy savings goals for investor-owned electric and gas utilities. The EERS statute does not set a fixed schedule of statewide percentages of energy savings to be achieved by particular years, nor does it require the acquisition of all cost-effective energy efficiency resources. Instead, it set an overall multi-year statewide savings goal for investor-owned electric utilities of at least 5% of the utility's retail sales (and a 5% peak demand reduction) relative to a 2006 baseline to be met by the end of 2018. HB 1227 (June 2017) extended programs to 2028, requiring the commission to set goals of at least 5% peak demand reduction and 5% energy savings by 2028 for demand-side management programs implemented during 2019 through 2028 compared to a 2018 basline.The statute includes a similar goal for reduction of peak demand of 5% of the retail system peak in 2006. 

For investor-owned natural gas utilities, the EERS legislation structured the requirement in two parts. First, the natural gas IOUs must set DSM spending targets of more than 0.5% of revenues from customers in the prior year. Energy savings targets are then established by COPUC commensurate with spending and are stated in terms of quantity of gas saved per dollar of efficiency program spending.

COPUC has modified targets several times since 2008 (see Docket No. 07A-420E, Decision C08-0560, Docket No. 08A-518E, Decision No. R09-0542). In May 2011, COPUC approved new goals for Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) for the 2012-2020 period. The goals begin at 1.14% of sales in 2012, ramping up to 1.35% in 2015, and reaching 1.68% in 2020. The goals set out to achieve 3,984 GWh in the nine-year period (see Docket No. 10A-554EG, Decision No. C11-0442). The Commission ruled in Proceeding No. 17A-0462EG that PSCo's goal for annual energy savings for 2019-2023 be 500 GWh, an increase from the goal of 400 GWh that had been in effect.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Colorado relies on regulatory orders. Evaluations are administered by the utilities. Colorado has established formal rules and procedures for evaluation. The utilities submit a set of technical assumptions as part of their respective plan filings, which are approved by the Commission (see?Stipulation and Settlement Agreement in Public Service Company Docket No. 08A-366EG). Statewide evaluations are conducted. According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Colorado relies on the Total Resource Cost (TRC) test and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in PUC?HB 07-1037. These benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio and total program level screening. Colorado’s TRC accounts for avoided costs of compliance with emissions regulations and benefits associated with improved public health, participant health and environmental benefits. Additional non-energy benefits (NEBs) may be included in a 10% adder as determined by the commission.  



Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Colorado is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

This was codified in Colorado statute 40-3.2.104, which directs utilities to provide funding for low-income energy-assistance programs such as bill assistance and weatherization through the assessment of a public benefits charge.

This funding is administered by the Colorado Energy Assistance Foundation (now Energy Outreach Colorado), created under section 40-8.5-104. Energy Outreach Colorado is required to file a report with the commission annually, showing amounts of money collected under the public benefits charge and demonstrating that the funds were used towards low-income energy bill payment assistance and energy efficiency improvements for affordable housing and non-profit facilities.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Decision No. C08-0560 directs the Colorado Public Service Commission to pursue all cost-effective low-income DSM programs, “but to not forego DSM programs simply because they do not pass a 1.0 TRC test.” It also directs that, in applying the TRC to low-income DSM programs, “the benefits included in the calculation shall be increased by 20%, to reflect the higher level of non-energy benefits that are likely to accrue from DSM services to low-income customers.” This was increased further to 50% for low-income measures and products in April 2018 under Decision No. C18-0417.

To avoid unintended impacts to calculations of benefits pursuant to performance incentives, the decision also allows utilities to exclude these costs in these determinations: “To address this concern we find that the costs and benefits associated with any low-income DSM program that is approved and has a TRC below 1.0 may be excluded from the calculation of net economic benefits. Further, the energy and demand savings may be applied toward the calculation of overall energy and demand savings, for purposes of determining progress toward annual goals.”

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Colorado Commission on Low-Income Energy Assistance is responsible for coordinating the state’s low-income energy assistance services pursuant to C.R.S. § 40-8.5-103.5 and Executive Order D 026 07. Many Colorado utilities have decided to enter into agreements with the Colorado Energy Office, the federal Weatherization Assistance Program grantee, and/or non-profits like Energy Outreach Colorado or community action agencies. In these instances, the funds generated by monthly surcharges are given to these other entities to provide services to the utility’s low-income customers.

","Self-direct programs for large customers are offered by Xcel Energy and Black Hills.

Xcel's self-direct program is available to commercial and industrial electric customers who have an aggregated peak load of at least 2 MW in any single month, an aggregated annual energy consumption of at least 10 GWh, and who are not allowed to participate in other conservation products offered by the company. Rebates are paid based on actual savings from a project, up to $525 per customer kW or $0.10 per kWh; rebates are given for either peak demand or energy savings but not both and are limited to 50% of the incremental cost of the project. Xcel uses raw monitoring results and engineering calculations to demonstrate actual energy and demand savings based on monitoring results.

To participate in the C&I Self-Direct program offered by Black Hills, customers must have an aggregated peak load greater than 1 MW in any single month and aggregated annual energy usage of 5,000 MWh.  Rebates and savings are calculated on a case-by-case basis; rebate values are calculated as either 50% of the incremental cost of the project or $0.30 per kWh savings, whichever is lower.

","All investor-owned natural gas utilities in Colorado recover lost revenues through an Acknowledgement of Lost Revenues (ALR) mechanism. The gas DSM rules were proposed in Proceeding No. 07R-371G and adopted in Decision No. C08-0248, which was issued on March 7, 2008. The ALR is only calculated for first-year savings. Electric utilities do not recover lost revenues. 

The 2009/10 Demand-Side Management (DSM) Plan was intended to remove disincentives to efficiency, offset revenue and earnings erosion, and reward utility performance, among other things, for the Public Service Company of Colorado. The PUC indicated that it is not appropriate and likely not feasible to define in a docket the lost margins resulting from DSM. Instead, it addressed the financial disincentives of DSM with a fixed payment of $2 million after taxes (approximately 3.2. million gross) for each year that 80% of the annual energy savings goal for an approved DSM plan is achieved, with the option that the offset could be adjusted downward in the case that the 80% target is not achieved . This amount is recovered over the 12-month period following the year in which the DSM plan is implemented. The PUC specifically notes that this “disincentive offset” should not be considered lost margin recovery but rather as an annual bonus for meeting approved DSM goals. Incentives are also included in the mechanism, and utilities achieving efficiency targets can earn a percentage of the net economic benefits generated by those savings. Combined total incentive payments are capped at 20% of PSCo’s annual DSM expenditures.

In 2018, the Commission ruled that, given the new 500 GWh energy savings goal, PSCo will begin to receive a performance incentive only when reaching 80% of the goal, or at 400 GWh (Decision No. C18-0417 Proceeding No. 17A-0462EG). There will be a disincentive offset of $3M that PSCo will earn in two installments; the first $1.5M will be given once PSCo reaches 400 GWh of savings (80% of goal), and the second $1.5M will be given when the company reaches 450 GWh of savings (90% of goal). The performance incentive for PSCo is 40% of incremental net benefits above 280 GWh up to 550 GWh upon achievement of at least 400 GWh. Total incentives are capped at $18M.

For natural gas utilities, the incentive bonus is capped at 25% of the expenditures or 20% of the net economic benefits of the DSM programs, whichever amount is lower.

","CHP in Energy Efficiency Standards:  Adopted in 1999, Maine’s Renewable Resources Portfolio Requirement allows electricity generated from efficient CHP systems and other systems that qualify as ""small power production facilities"" under the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) as eligible. CHP counts toward renewable resources in the state, provided it is at least 60% efficient. Maine electricity providers must supply at least 30% of their total sales as renewable resources. In 2007, Maine created mandatory standards for new generation resources, with a goal of 10% of new energy resources to be supplied by renewable resources by 2017 and thereafter.

Production goal: Maine law requires that the utilities (through Efficiency Maine Trust) develop and procure all cost-effective, reliable and achievable energy efficiency resources (MACE) in the state (35-A MRS §§10110 and 10111). Based on the most recent MACE Potential Study, Efficiency Maine Trust is required to pursue 646,022 MWh in CHP savings over the next 10 years. The plan calls for Efficiency Maine to add incremental delivery of 42,000 MWh from CHP in 2017, 53,000 MWh in 2018, and 64,000 MWh in 2019. Qualifying CHP projects will receive from Efficiency Maine a minimum of $10,000 to a maximum of $1 million per facility or up to 50% of the total project costs.

Incentive awards range from $10,000 and $1,000,000 per project, or up to 50% of total project costs. In 2017, the program ran a limited-time bonus incentive for CHP projects, offering assistance for up to 70% of total project costs. While this bonus ended, Efficiency Maine continues to collaborate with the University of Maine-led CHP Technical Assistance Partnership center on CHP project outreach efforts.

Net Metering: All of Maine's electric utilities -- investor-owned utilities (IOUs), consumer-owned utilities (COUs, which include municipal utilities and electric cooperatives) -- must offer net energy billing (net metering) for individual customers. IOUs are required to offer net metering to eligible facilities with capacity limits up to 660 kilowatts (kW). COUs are required to offer net metering to customer-generators up to 100 kW, but, they are authorized to offer net metering to eligible facilities with capacity limits up to 660 kW at their discretion.

Net metering is available to owners of eligible, qualified facilities, including facilities generating electricity using eligible CHP systems. CHP systems must meet efficiency requirements in order to qualify for net metering: micro-CHP 30 kW and below must achieve combined electrical and thermal efficiency of 80% or greater, and micro-CHP 31 kW to 660 kW must achieve combined efficiency of 65% or greater.

Requirements for Provision of Energy Data

Maine requires the provision of individual meter data to customers in an electronic format and to third parties upon authorization of the customer. Data is generally provided via spreadsheet through secure electronic transfer. Utilities cannot disclose customer information except for debt collection, credit reporting, usage reporting pursuant to state and federal law, law enforcement requests, and in response to a Commission Order. Third-party eligibility depends on whether or not the party falls into one of these exemptions. Efficiency Maine has been granted access to individual meter data through a Commission Order.

Energy Use Data Availability

Energy use data may be requested by Efficiency Maine by submitting the request to the Maine Public Utilities Commission. The Commission will issue a Protective Order that ensures the confidentiality of the data. Efficiency Maine has the authority to request this data under the Efficiency Maine Trust Act (35-A M.R.S.A. §10104(4)(A)(1)).

","Summary: Cumulative electricity savings of 4,300 GWh by 2030 (equal to approximately 30% of forecast electricity sales, or 1.4% annual savings).

Hawaii’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS) was codified in HRS §269-91, et seq. and amended in 2006, 2008, and 2009. The RPS requires investor-owned utilities and rural electric cooperative utilities to use “renewable electrical energy” to meet 10% of net electricity sales by the end of 2010, 15% by 2015, 25% by 2020, and 40% by 2030. Savings from energy efficiency programs and combined heat and power systems (among other measures) may count towards meeting up to 50% of the standard through 2014. The Public Utilities Commission may assess penalties against a utility for failing to meet the RPS, unless the failure was beyond the reasonable control of the utility.  

Beginning in 2015, electrical energy savings will no longer be able to count toward Hawaii’s RPS and will instead count towards Hawaii’s Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS), which was established in 2009 with the passage of HR 1464. Hawaii's EEPS sets a goal to reduce electricity consumption by 4,300 GWh by 2030 (equal to approximately 30% of forecast electricity sales, or 1.4% annual savings). Renewable displacement or offset technologies, including solar water heating and sea-water air-conditioning district cooling systems, count towards the EEPS after 2015.

The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) must establish interim goals to be achieved by 2015, 2020, and 2025, and may adjust the 2030 standard to maximize cost-effective energy efficiency programs and technologies. The PUC has yet to establish rules for the stand-alone EEPS, including eligible technologies; responsibility for doing so falls on the EEPS Technical Working Group established in 2012. Current energy efficiency targets in Hawaii are set in HI PUC Order, Docket No. 2010-0037 and are subject to revision.

Hawaii has no energy efficiency resource standard in place for natural gas due to the fact that natural gas plays only a minimal role in the state's overall energy portfolio.

In July 2009 Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) transferred administration of its energy efficiency programs to a third-party “Public Benefits Fee” administrator. The governor’s office claimed: “Moving energy efficiency programs to an independent third party will remove the perceived conflict between the electric utilities' desire to sell more electricity to increase profitability and the desire to implement energy efficiency programs that will decrease electricity sales.” The third-party contractor (Hawaii Energy) negotiated to run HECO's energy efficiency program is compensated by the Commission for satisfactory performance of its contract (See Hawaii Energy Executive Summary in Annual Report PY 2009).

New Jersey's Clean Energy Program now offers free benchmarking for specific commercial & industrial sectors, including hospitals and healthcare, municipalities, industries, hospitality, multifamily, higher education, K-12 public schools, retail and others. The proposed FY20 budget recommends increasing the cap on energy audits on hospitals from $100,000 to $300,000, which should increase program participation and energy savings among potential participants that tend to have large, complex facilities. Since 2008, the Clean Energy Division has done nearly 1500 audits and benchmarks across all sectors.

New Jersey leads by example with an initiative to increase the energy efficiency of state owned or operated facilities and buildings. Energy Savings Improvement Programs (ESIP) will be used for energy efficiency and energy conservation improvements, renewable energy upgrades, and the expansion of other green oriented programs - particularly demand response and combined heat and power. These initiatives will contribute to the state’s goal of reducing energy usage across the state 20% by 2020. The FY20 proposed budget includes an increase in funding for State Facilities for a total of $37,810,430 to go to various energy efficiency programs.

Through the BPU, the State Facilities Initiative identifies and implements energy efficiency projects in State-owned facilities with the objective of producing energy and cost savings. The Energy Capital Committee (“ECC”) consisting of members from Treasury and the BPU Division of State Energy Services coordinates and recommends approval of these projects based on evaluation of capital costs and anticipated energy savings.

The list of planned projects includes those identified through energy audits completed, in progress or proposed for various State facilities, as well as projects requested by State agencies on an annual basis and in support of policy goals identified in the Energy Master Plan. In FY18, the State Facilities Budget was $100,000 with a carryover commitment for $7.6 million for three major EE upgrades. In FY19, the State Facilities initiative budget was increased to $5 million plus additional committed carryover. Additionally, state agencies are encouraged to utilize the New Jersey Clean Energy Program’s Local Government Energy Audit program which provides 100% of the costs of audits to local and state facilities.

The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities established the Office of State Energy Facilities in order to advance energy efficiency and renewable energy in state facilities. This office has access to the suite of energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives in the NJ Clean Energy Program (NJCEP). Through this program, the state offers free energy audits and benchmarking for public facilities, including state, county, and local governments, non-profits, and state colleges and universities. Benchmarking reports for these facilities are posted online. The Division of State Energy Services, as part of the ECC, has access to a $100 million line of credit for state energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and strongly encourages and promotes the use of these programs that result in energy efficient improvements. While the original $100 million backing has been almost exhausted through projects and commitments, a new line of credit will be established later in 2019 to continue these efforts. New Jersey Treasury uses a statewide system called Energy Solves to track energy bills and usage and identify outlying state facilities that need energy efficiency upgrades. The Division of State Energy Services has started to develop a plan forward to tackle these largest energy users.

The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs and the Rutgers Center for Green Buildings have developed a green building manual for owners and builders interested in designing, constructing, and operating their buildings above code.

",3 out of 3,"New Jersey includes CHP in its energy efficiency resource standard and offers several incentives and financing programs for CHP projects. Seventeen new CHP installations were completed in 2018.
","Policy: New Jersey Administrative Code 14:4-9

Description: As required by the Board of Public Utilities, each electric utility in the state has approved interconnection standards applicable to CHP and other forms of generation. The interconnection standards have 3 levels: Level 1 for projects ","CHP in energy efficiency standards: New Jersey adopted an EERS in May 2018 with 2% electric and 0.75% gas savings goals. The policy specifically excludes natural gas used for CHP from gas savings goals. 

The state also adopted a budget of $29 million in FY 2018 for CHP incentives.

Last Updated: August 2019
","Incentives, grants, or financing: New Jersey provides incentives for CHP deployment through several programs.

New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program (NJCEP) offers financial incentives for several types of CHP facilities, including non-renewable, renewable, fuel cell, and waste heat to power systems. The program provides an incentive ($/W) depending on system type and size for projects that meet a 60% HHV CHP efficiency standard. A bonus incentive of 25% of the total system incentive for a system incorporating blackstart technology at a critical facility is now available.

The state’s Cogeneration Tax Exemption provides a sales and use tax exemption on natural gas purchases for customers using gas to fuel on-site energy generation. Additionally, the Act amended the definition of “contiguous property” to include those buildings attached to or served by a district thermal energy system. This definition allows electricity generated by the system to be delivered to other facilities served by the same thermal district energy system, using existing infrastructure and at prevailing wheeling tariffs.

Last Updated: August 2019
","Some additional supportive policies exist to encourage CHP in New jersey. The state’s Superstorm Sandy Action Plan includes funding specifically for CHP and recommends that critical infrastructure use CHP in order to increase the system resiliency. New Jersey also changed the definition of contiguous property to help promote CHP system incorporation with district energy systems.

The state's CHP incentive program provides additional bonus incentives to CHP systems with blackstart capabilities at critical infrastrucutre, and supports renewable-fueled systems.

New Jersey has also streamlined its air permitting process by offering a general permit for some eligible CHP systems, allowing a range of facilities to more quickly and easily install CHP technology. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) developed two GPs: one for internal combustion engines (General Permit CHP-022) and one for turbines (General Permit CHP-021). Each GP contains four different sets of fuel and emission limits, depending on the size of the equipment and how the source plans to operate the equipment.

",6.5 out of 20,"Since 2003, the Office of Clean Energy within the Board of Public Utilities has administered the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, which has offered statewide customer energy efficiency programs. Prior to this, the regulated energy utilities in New Jersey had been responsible for administering electric and natural gas efficiency programs.

New Jersey electric programs have been successful in generating significant savings. However, portions of the state’s societal benefit charge (SBC) have been re-allocated to pay state energy bills in recent years, reducing potential energy efficiency programming.

Natural gas programs are also available to customers within the state.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","Prior to 2007, utilities were required to administer and implement energy efficiency programs with oversight from the BPU. In 2002, the New Jersey BPU began a re-assessment of this administrative structure and in 2007 program administration was turned over to the Office of Clean Energy (OCE). OCE meets monthly with energy efficiency and renewable energy program managers, the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, and the state's utilities to plan and coordinate programs. The OCE also chairs monthly meetings with stakeholders to solicit input on programs and budgets.

Several utilities provide incentives that supplement New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program or administer energy efficiency programs that do not compete with those offered through NJCEP.  For example, several utilities offer incentives for highly efficient hot water heaters, boilers, and furnaces. While the NJCEP already offers incentives for these products, the aforementioned utilities offer additional incentives to further encourage their customers to purchase these efficient technologies. Some utilities also offer financing options to customers in their service territory who wish to participate in specified NJCEP residential and commercial programs. By offering on-bill repayment options and low-to-zero interest loans to participating customers, these utilities both lessen the cost burden for customers and attract additional participants that may have been otherwise unable to enroll in these programs.

Additionally, several companies offer residential behavioral analysis programs that utilize customer data to provide residents with breakdowns of their energy usage, comparisons to similar homes in the area, and recommendations to optimize their energy use and conserve energy (including enrolling in other energy efficiency programs). Utilities also offer programs focusing on low-to-moderate income customers, small businesses, and hospitals to ensure that all customer segments have the ability to participate in energy efficiency. 

Today, investor-owned utilities are still responsible for collecting the Societal Benefit Charge (SBC) for the programs and then transfer these funds to the state. However, state’s societal benefit charge has repeatedly been reallocated away from energy efficiency programming.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), New Jersey relies on the Total Resource Cost Test (TRC) and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. Nominally, New Jersey’s TRC accounts for non-energy benefits such as other energy fuel savings and water savings and quality benefits, but values do not appear to be included in practice. Low-income programs are not required to pass cost-effectiveness tests.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The State’s low-income energy efficiency program, New Jersey Comfort Partners, arose out of 1999 restructuring legislation that designated a systems benefit charge as the funding source for energy efficiency programs. A low-income program is required as set forth in EDECA 1999 at NJSA 48:3-61. The NJBPU has approved a low-income energy efficiency program since 2001. There appear to be no specific levels of required of spending, although each year the program budget does specify annual goals for number of customers served.

For FY20, the NJBPU has also proposed an increase in the income eligibility limits, from 225% of Federal Poverty Guidelines to 250% of Federal Poverty Guidelines in order to expand the program’s availability and increase access for residents of New Jersey. Annual goals for energy savings and the number of customers served are established in the program filings, during FY2018 the program served 3,894 households and saved 4,394,902 KwH and 248,973 Therms.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The NJBPU does not require that the Comfort Partners Program meet any cost-effectiveness tests. Implementation of a low income energy efficiency program is required by NJSA 48:3-61 and does not require any cost effectiveness tests. The low income EE CPP based on the energy audit implements all measures at the full cost plus measures required to address health and safety that are within the budget and seasonal spending guidelines.  If this level is not sufficient to implement the measures, the program can request additional approved spending. This process is set in the utilities filing and approved priority list.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

In addition to opportunities through Comfort Partners, New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs (NJDCA) administers the federally-funded Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The Office of Low-Income Energy Conservation (OLIEC) within the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) is responsible for administration of the state’s Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).The DCA established WAP to aid low-income households, with an emphasis on those who are high-energy users, have a high energy burden, are elderly or disabled, in order to decrease fuel consumption and related energy costs. The program is intended to reduce both the national energy consumption and the impact of higher fuel costs on low-income families. Funds are provided to facilitate several energy conservation measures, including but not limited to building shell, air-sealing, hot water conservation measures, attic, sidewall, and foundation insulation and electric base load measures.   

In order to expand access for low-income residents to energy efficiency opportunities, in 2018 the NJBPU and NJDCA approved a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), to jointly deliver Comfort Partners and WAP services, in particular situations. The similar mission statements and target populations of the programs make the combination of efforts and resources a good fit for both programs and the MOU allows the NJ to more efficiently and comprehensively serve New Jersey’s residents and provide critical upgrades to residents. Through this MOU, NJBPU and NJDCA are able to coordinate the delivery of Comfort Partners and WAP services, streamline and increase customer access and are ultimately able to address concerns and provide weatherization in homes where otherwise the barriers to efficiency and weatherization were too great for one program to handle alone.

These rules implement the Air Pollution Control Act provisions at N.J.S.A. 26:2C-8.15, which require the Department to promulgate rules to implement the California LEV program in New Jersey. The New Jersey program contains three components: vehicle emission standards, fleet wide emission requirements, and a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales requirement. The rules will require automakers to reduce fleet-wide greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicles they sell in New Jersey 30% by 2016. The state has also adopted California's Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program, which requires increasing production of plug-in hybrid, battery electric, and fuel-cell vehicles from 2018 to 2025.

On April 3rd, 2018, Governor Murphy reaffirmed New Jersey’s support for federal fuel emissions standards and signed a multi-state agreement on clean vehicles. Furthermore, in December 2018, New Jersey committed to working with Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states in designing a new regional low-carbon transportation policy proposal that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.

In January 2008, New Jersey passed the “Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit Act,” providing businesses that choose to locate in “urban transit hubs” – defined as the area in a one-half mile radius around rail stations -- with tax credits. This law was amended by the New Jersey Economic Stimulus Act of 2009, requiring businesses to invest at least $50,000,000 in a business or residential facility before it can earn tax credits that can be applied to corporate business taxes, insurance premiums tax or income tax.

On November 2, 2018, Governor Phil Murphy signed into law a bill requiring NJ TRANSIT to establish an office of real estate economic development and TOD. The purpose of the new office was to assess and develop recommendations for economic development and TOD opportunities for parcels of real property owned by NJ Transit. The hope is that the full inventory and emphasis on economic development within NJ Transit will generate more private-sector interest in developing agency-owned properties, ultimately creating a new revenue stream that could ease the burden on riders. Such development could, in turn, complement existing and contemplated TOD projects in both designated Transit Villages and in non-designated municipalities.

",2 out of 3,"CHP is included as an eligible resource within the state's alternative portfolio standard and CHP deployment is encouraged through additional policies and technical assistance efforts. The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission issued a CHP policy statement in 2018 encouraging utilities to make CHP an integral part of their energy efficiency & resilience plans, design interconnection and standby rates, and promote the consideration of special natural gas rates for owners and operators of CHP facilities. One new CHP system was installed in Pennsylvania in 2018.
","Policy: Pennsylvania Administrative Code Title 52, Chapter 75, Subchapter C

Description: Pennsylvania, in accordance with its Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act of 2004, adopted interconnection standards for DG, including CHP, in August 2006. The standards cover four different tiers of interconnection, up to 5 MW in size. Specific technical screens and timelines are associated with each level of interconnection. Pennsylvania’s standards were based upon the model interconnection standards promulgated by the Mid-Atlantic Distributed Resources Initiative Working Group, and also adhere to the technical standards delineated in the IEEE 1547 interconnection standards.

In October 2016, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission issued an final order amending interconnection rules that reflected a number of adjustments, including raising the size-limit on customer generation capacity.

","CHP in energy efficiency standards: CHP is an eligible resource under Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). The standard was adopted in 2004 and then amended in 2007 and requires all electric distribution companies and retail electric generation suppliers to ensure that 18% of their electricity is derived from alternative energy resources by 2020. The standard divides these requirements into three tiers to develop a compliance schedule to gradually reach the 18% goal. CHP is part of Tier II, which must comprise 10% of the total electricity supply by 2020. The other 8% is to be comprised of renewable resources. 

Revenue streams: CHP systems are eligible to receive production incentives (per kWh) through Pennsylvania’s AEPS, which provides compliance credits that are based on production. Also, some major utilities in Pennsylvania, including PECO, First Energy and PPL, offer performance incentives for CHP to their customer base in their respective territories. These utility-run program offerings provide financial incentives to commercial and industrial customers that employ CHP to reduce their energy consumption and demand usage.

Last Updated: July 2018
","Incentives, grants, or financing: CHP systems may have access to state grants and loans through the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority (PEDA) and Commonwealth Financing Authority’s Alternative Clean Energy (ACE) Program.

Net metering:   Net metering rules apply to CHP in Pennsylvania. The PUC adopted net-metering rules and interconnection standards for net-metered systems and other forms of DG in 2006, pursuant to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) Act of 2004. In 2007, H.B. 1203 amended the Pennsylvania AEPS and also expanded net metering. Revised rules consistent with these amendments were adopted by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC), effective November 29, 2008 (PUC Omitted Rulemaking Order, Docket L-00050174).

In Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities must offer net metering to residential customers that generate electricity with systems up to 50 kilowatts (kW) in capacity; nonresidential customers with systems up to three megawatts (MW) in capacity; and customers with systems greater than 3 MW but no more than 5 MW who make their systems available to the grid during emergencies. Net metering is available when any portion of the electricity generated is used to offset on-site consumption (i.e., system size is not limited by the customer's on-site load). Systems eligible for net metering include those that generate electricity using combined heat and power (CHP) technologies.

","Some additional supportive policies exist in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and other entities are working toward the promotion of CHP through a CHP policy statement published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin on April 5, 2018. The main purpose is to encourage Electricity Distribution Companies (EDCs) and Natural Gas Distribution Companies (NGDCs) to: make CHP an integral part of their energy efficiency and resiliency plans, design interconnection and standby rates, and promote the consideration of special natural gas rates, for owners and operators of CHP facilities. EDCs will be required to report on their CHP activities.

In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection partnered with the Penn State University Mid-Atlantic CHP TAP at The Navy Yard in Philadelphia to conduct a pilot microgrid demonstration project that integrates CHP and renewable energy. The project will of share lessons learned, provide technical assistance to others in the state, and act as a demonstration site for the U.S. DOE’s Grid Modernization program. Efforts to develop a “CHP-Enabled Renewable Energy Guide” are also underway.

The state also encourages the use of renewable-fueled CHP systems through its AEPS, which recognizes renewable CHP as eligible as a Tier I resource.

",4.5 out of 20,"Pennsylvania utilities have significantly expanded energy efficiency program offerings in recent years since the enactment of the state’s EERS in 2008 (Act 129), with oversight by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). Pennsylvania Act 129 required each of the seven major electric distribution companies (EDCs) to procure cost-effective energy efficiency and to develop energy efficiency and conservation plans to reduce electricity consumption by a minimum 1% by 2011, increasing to a total of 3% by 2013, and to reduce peak demand by 4.5% by 2013. In August 2012, the Pennsylvania PUC issued an implementation order for Phase II of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Program, establishing electricity savings targets for each EDC over the 3-year period from FY2014-2016. The targets amounted to an average of 2.3% cumulative savings over the 3-year period; no incremental annual targets were established. Phase III targets set 5-year cumulative targets of 5,710,487 MWh, equivalent to about 0.77% incremental savings per year through 2020.

On June 11, 2015, the Commission adopted additional incremental reductions in consumption for a Phase III of the Act 129 Energy Efficiency and Conservation Program. Phase III began on June 1, 2016, and will end on May 31, 2021. Phase III requires a cumulative average savings of approximately 3.7% (range of 2.6% to 5.0%) from EE and also includes a DR requirement with average annual savings of 425 MW. (See pages 35 and 57 of the implementation order, Docket #M 2014-2424864, for details on DR and EE, respectively).

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

For further reading, in May 2009, as part of the State Clean Energy Resource Project, ACEEE completed the report Potential for Energy Efficiency, Demand Response, and Onsite Solar Energy in Pennsylvania.
","Pennsylvania utilities have significantly expanded energy efficiency program offerings in recent years since the enactment of the state’s EERS established by Act 129 in 2008. In accordance with this law, each electric distribution company filed an energy efficiency and conservation (EEC) plan with the PUC in July 2009. Plans submitted by each company explain how energy reductions are to be met, including a contract with a conservation service provider, and provide for energy efficiency measures for low-income households. The PUC may approve, reject, or modify the plans.

Under Act 129, the electric distribution companies’ energy efficiency and conservation plans propose a cost-recovery tariff mechanism to fund the energy efficiency and conservation measures and to ensure recovery of reasonable costs. The utilities can also recover the costs through a reconcilable adjustment mechanism. 

There are additional EE programs for natural gas customers of PGW (Phila. Gas Works), UGI North, and UGI South, as well as UGI Electric. All of these programs's offerings are voluntary but approved by the PUC. UGI Electric is one of four small EDCs that are below the threshold for compliance with Act 129 (EERS) but which were encouraged to adopt voluntary programs for their customers. Additionally, PA has 13 rural electric cooperatives and several smaller municipalities that are not regulated by the Commission. The rural electric cooperatives do offer some electric efficiency programs/incentives.

In 2016, the Commission approved a rate case for UGI Utilities and as part of that settlement approved UGI Utilities plans to implement a natural gas EE&C program for its approximately 390,000 customers. That plan became effective in calendar year 2017.

	Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test 
	




The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Pennsylvania relies on both legislative mandates and regulatory orders. The order follows the legislation. Evaluations are mainly administered by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, but there are no specific legal requirements for these evaluations in Pennsylvania. Evaluations are conducted for each of the utilities. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in M-2009-2108601. The state uses a Technical Reference Manual to measure and verify applicable energy efficiency measures.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Pennsylvania specifies the total resource cost test (TRC) as its primary test for decision making. A benefit-cost test is required for portfolio level screening.

The non-energy benefit of participant productivity is accounted for in Pennsylvania’s TRC. The primary test also monetizes the value of avoided water, gas, oil, and propane. Although the commission does not favor general percentage-based adders, they believe it is important to quantify the savings associated with water and fossil fuel savings. The commission decided not to include non-electric benefits such as participant asset value, economic well-being, comfort, health and safety, satisfaction in Pennsylvania’s primary test. The commission also decided not to account for societal costs, environmental costs, non-energy impacts, or other non-electric elements such as environmental, public health, economic development and jobs, or energy security in the TRC.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In June 2015, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) issued an implementation order for Phase III of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EE&C) Program, setting five-year cumulative targets of 5.7 million MWh, equivalent to about 0.8% of incremental savings per year through 2021. The order also requires each utility to obtain a minimum of 5.5% of their total consumption reduction target from the low-income sector.

In addition, utilities coordinate Act 129 low-income energy efficiency programs with the Low-Income Usage Reduction Program (LIURP). LIURP is a statewide, utility-sponsored usage-reduction program mandated by the Electric and Gas Choice Competition Act at 66 Pa.C.S.A. 2803 for electric and 2202 for gas, as part of the Universal Service Programs required for those customers who are at or below 150% of the Federal Income Poverty Guidelines. Details are available in each years’ Universal Service Report on the PUC website. 

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In Order M-2015-2468992, the PUC specifies 2016 total resource cost test requirements. Pennsylvania relies on the total resource cost (TRC) test and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. A benefit-cost test is required for portfolio-level screening. The commission requires that the electric distribution companies provide benefit and cost data for both low-income and estimated non-low-income residential program savings in their annual reports and that TRC Tests be calculated for all low-income programs and all residential programs. However, the Commission does not require a separate PA TRC test calculation for the low-income sector, as separate PA TRC tests are not required for any other customer sector.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The PA Dept. of Community and Economic Development (DCED) has a Weatherization Policy Advisory Council, of which the PUC is a voting member. There is a Coordination Committee, formed in 2012, that is charged with the specific task of coordinating the WAP program with LIURP and the Act 129 Low-Income Programs. There is a 2016 MOU that was put into place between DCED and the PUC to facilitate data sharing between all the agencies’ weatherization programs, but this MOU has not been posted or made publicly available.

","Summary: Cumulative annual electricity savings of 22% of retail sales and natural gas savings of 6% by 2020.

In 2010 the Arizona Corporation Commission ordered that, by 2020, each investor-owned utility must achieve cumulative annual electricity savings of at least 22% of its retail electric sales in calendar year 2019 through cost-effective energy efficiency programs (see Docket No. RE-00000C-09-0427, Decision No. 71436, and Decision No. 71819). Cumulative annual targets for electricity savings are specified for each year, beginning at 1.25% in 2011, and are based on retail electricity sales in the previous calendar year. Electric distribution cooperatives must propose an annual energy savings goal that is at least 75% of the standard in a given year.

Peak demand savings achieved through demand response programs are allowed to qualify for up to two percentage points of the total 22% cumulative goal (based on a conversion of demand to energy), but there is a limit to the amount of peak demand savings that can be applied to the energy efficiency standard in any given year. Utilities can count energy supply from combined heat and power systems that do not qualify under the state's Renewable Energy Standards towards the energy efficiency standard, as well as one-third of the measured savings from new building codes. Utilities are allowed to credit energy savings achieved during 2005-2010 towards the requirements beginning in 2016.

Utilities must submit an annual or biennial implementation plan to detail progress in meeting goals and to estimate cost and energy savings for programs over the next two calendar years. Utilities may recover the prudent costs of energy efficiency programs through a DSM tariff, and utilities may also request the Commission to consider the use of performance incentives to assist in achieving the goals.

Arizona also has natural gas efficiency standards requiring 6% cumulative savings by 2020 (see Docket No. RG-00000B-09-0428 and Decision No. 71855). As in the case of electric cooperatives, gas cooperatives must propose annual savings goals that achieve 75% of the standard; propane companies must meet 50% of the standard. Energy savings from renewable energy projects sponsored by an affected utility may count towards meeting up to 25% of the standard in any given year.

Salt River Project has also set long-term energy savings goals through its Sustainable Portfolio Principles. These principles establish targets for the utility through its 2020 fiscal year and ramp up to 2% beginning in FY 2018.

Third parties conduct evaluations for each regulated utility. Arizona has established formal rules and procedures for evaluation, documenting them in A.A.C. R14-2-2409 and R14-2-2415. Arizona uses the Societal Cost Test (SCT) and considers it the primary cost-effectiveness test; SCT rules are in A.A.C. R14-2-2401(36) and R14-2-2412(B).

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Arizona applies the Societal Cost Test (SCT) primarily at the portfolio level and secondarily at the program and measure level. Arizona’s SCT accounts for non-energy costs and benefits associated with productivity (improved systems operations), health and safety, participant satisfaction (customer service), water savings, environmental impacts, and public health (health effects from burning fossil fuels).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

No specific required spending or savings requirements were identified. In 2010, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) ordered in Decision 71819 that each investor-owned utility must achieve cumulative annual electricity savings of at least 22% of its retail electric sales in calendar year 2019 through cost-effective energy efficiency programs. The decision ordered that utilities “…allocate a portion of DSM resources specifically to low-income customers,” but does not identify a minimum spending level.

Utility funds dedicated to weatherization, in addition to DOE funds for weatherization, are managed by the Arizona Department of Housing (ADOH).

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Since 2011, Arizona Administrative Code Title 14, Chapter 2, Article 24 (R14-2-2412) has directed that “…an affected utility’s low-income customer program portfolio shall be cost-effective, but costs attributable to necessary health and safety measures shall not be used in the calculation.”

","All the major electric utilities offer a self-direct option for large customers. Arizona Public Service (APS) states that large customers using at least 40 million kWh per calendar year can elect to self-direct energy efficiency funds. Customers must notify APS each year if they wish to participate, after which 85% of the customer's demand-side management contribution will be reserved for future energy efficiency projects. Projects must be completed within two years. Self-direction funds are paid once per year once the project is completed and verified by APS. To be eligible for self-direction under Tucson Electric Power, a customer must use a minimum of 35 million kWh per calendar year. The Salt River Project makes self-direction available only to very large customers using more than 240 million kWh per year. For all utilities, a portion of the funds they would have otherwise contributed to energy efficiency is retained to cover the self-direction program administration, management, and evaluation costs.

","Since 2004, New Hampshire has been working to improve energy usage in state buildings. Executive Order 2004-7 (2004) authorized a committee to develop an energy reduction goal and plan, a procedure for conducting audits of facilities that score between 40 and 60 on the ENERGY STAR benchmarking system, new energy efficiency standards for new construction, and a procedure for commissioning new facilities that ensures adoption of energy-efficient design specifications and equipment operations.

In 2010, SB73 mandated that all agencies enter energy, water, and sewer data into a statewide tracking database in order to assess progress and properly benchmark success.

New Hampshire law (RSA 155-A:13) requires that any state owned building that is newly constructed, reconstructed, altered or renovated such that it constitutes a major project, must meet a high performance design standard. The incremental costs related to any energy efficiency and sustainable design features may be recouped over a 10 year period.

Executive Order 2011-01 called for a 25% reduction in fossil fuel energy usage in state buildings by 2025 and a system to track and benchmark progress toward this goal.  The significant energy efficiency efforts and results thus far have already reduced fossil fuel energy use by 21% per square foot in State Buildings.

On May 6, 2016 Executive Order 2016-03 (supersedes EO 2011-01) was signed setting new, aggressive goals for state government on energy efficiency, conservation and renewable energy.  This Executive Order recognizes the significant energy efficiency efforts and results thus far have already reduced fossil fuel energy use by 21% per square foot in State Buildings and sets new savings targets for State Vehicle Fleet and State Building energy use. Further it sets updated goals of reducing fossil fuel use at state-owned facilities by 30 percent by 2020, 40 percent by 2025 and 50 percent by 2030, compared to a 2005 baseline; reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the state passenger vehicle fleet by 30 percent on a metric-ton basis by 2030, as compared to a 2010 baseline; enhancing construction and renovation standards; and increasing management and tracking of energy consumption.

","In February 2010 Governor Markell issued Executive Order 18, which set a variety of energy conservation goals and requirements intended to make the state a leader by example in clean energy and sustainability.

Under Executive Order No. 18 (EO 18), executive branch State agencies and departments in State-owned or State-leased buildings were directed to achieve an overall collective reduction of 30%, subject to funding opportunities and constraints, by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 when compared to FY 2008. The order further prescribed a series of energy conservation practices for state employees to follow, such as turning off lights when they are not in use, eliminating the use of portable appliances, following green computing practices, and maintaining appropriate thermostat settings. The order also directed new construction and major renovation projects to be designed to meet or exceed the USGBC LEED Silver rating standards, and certification must be pursued for such projects if it can be accomplished at a reasonable cost. EO 18 also directs executive agencies and departments to procure at least 30% of their electricity load from clean, renewable sources.

As an extension of the State's efforts to track energy use in public buildings, Delaware joined the Better Buildings Challenge (BBC) in 2012. The BBC is a voluntary program administered by the U.S. Department of Energy, setting long range energy reduction goals for building portfolios and requiring partners to track and report detailed energy use annually. The BBC also requires partners to submit at least one showcase project to demonstrate best practices in energy efficiency and energy conservation, as well as develop and follow an implementation model that serves as a playbook to achieve energy use goals, identify barriers, and implement replicable solutions. The State currently tracks executive branch State buildings over 1,500 square feet using EPA's Portfolio Manager tracking database, or over 8 million square feet of state owned public building space. This achievement marked the State's successful completion of all BBC requirements, and as a result, Delaware was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy as a BBC goal achiever. The State continues to participate in the BBC, and is being recognized for energy reporting for the 6th year in a row.

",3 out of 20,"/Delaware has made advances toward strengthening its energy efficiency programs, establishing the nonprofit Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) to operate programs to deliver comprehensive end-user efficiency and customer-sited renewable energy services. SEU operates as “Energize Delaware.” Since 2006, Delaware law has required electricity providers to engage in integrated resource planning (IRP). In 2009, Delaware approved an Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) that set goals for consumption and peak demand for electricity and natural gas utilities. The goals are 15% electricity consumption and peak demand savings and 10% natural gas consumption savings by 2015. However, rules outlining how these goals are to be met are still pending.

In 2014, the state legislature passed SB 150, an amendment calling for expansion of cost-effective electric and natural gas utility programs and allowing utilities to deliver these programs and recover costs through rates. SB 150 created the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC), which established voluntary energy savings targets (electric and gas), similar to the EERS. The incremental energy efficiency targets are incremental annual savings as a percent of forecasted sales.

2016/2017 targets:  0.4% electric, 0.2% natural gas

2018 targets: 0.7% electric, 0.3% natural gas

","Summary: Delaware does not have a mandatory EERS. However, energy savings targets have been set by the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC) and affected energy providers are currently working to meet these goals.

Established by SB 150, House Amendment 2 in 2014, the Delaware Energy Efficiency Advisory Council convened to establish guidance on cost-effective energy efficiency programs. The Delaware Energy Efficiency Advisory Council (EEAC) provides guidance to energy providers in developing energy efficiency, energy conservation, peak demand reduction, and emission-reducing fuel switching programs for all customer classes. The EEAC collaborates with the Public Service Commission (PSC) and Public Advocate (PA) to guide energy providers in establishing 3-year program  portfolios that must be approved by the PSC or other appropriate regulatory body.

The Act set up an eleven-member stakeholder workgroup to assist in developing key regulations, assessing the feasibility and impact of pursuing the established targets, reviewing progress annually, and recommending changes to the plan as needed. In its June 2011 report, the workgroup identified several issues that undercut the effectiveness of the policy. First, the level of proposed funding (gathered through an energy efficiency charge on customer bills) made it unlikely that the state would meet the targets established in the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards Act. Second, the workgroup found that conflicting state statutes muddied the institutional structure around efficiency program implementation and accountability, making it impossible to determine which entity (utilities, the Sustainable Energy Utility, or the Public Service Commission) has accountability for EERS performance results and the development of enforcement mechanisms.  

Given the lack of final implementation rules, and the funding and institutional challenges outlined above, Delaware's energy savings targets are considered voluntary.

Established by SB 150, House Amendment 2 in 2014, the EEAC convened to establish guidance on cost-effective energy efficiency programs. The EEAC has established voluntary energy savings targets (electric and gas), similar to the EERS. Utilities and program administrators are encouraged through the EEAC to develop and implement energy efficiency programs that will yield a reduction in electric and natural gas usage. Programs plans are designed around a 3-year timeframe but have the ability to be updated annually, with annual targets increasing each year to reach the cumulative 3-year goal.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Delaware established legislative energy savings targets in 2009 with the adoption of SB 106, although these have yet to be implemented. The legislation sets up a Sustainable Energy Trust Fund to collect charges assessed by energy providers in service of energy savings goals. SB 106 specifies that 20% of assessment be provided to the Weatherization Assistance Program.

Electric utility restructuring legislation passed in 1999 specifies that Delmarva Power and Light collect 0.095 mills/kWh (approximately $800,000 annually) from customers to be forwarded to the Department of Health and Social Services, Division of State Service Centers, to be used to fund low-income fuel assistance and weatherization programs.

The Delaware Weatherization Assistance Program has an annual goal of completing 400 homes.   In addition, to make low-income energy efficiency programs more accessible, a Guidance Document was drafted in 2016 as part of the merger settlements approved by the PSC between Exelon and Delmarva Power and Light to allocate $4,000,000 of the funds towards low-income customer energy efficiency programs. This Guidance Document applies to DPL customers, and funds are available to support organizations delivering energy efficiency programs to low-income rate payers. Organizations that receive grants to run low-income energy efficiency programs will increase energy efficiency measures for low-income Delaware households, increase statewide electric and gas savings, engage and inform low-income households about the benefits of energy efficiency, develop a community-based approach to address energy efficiency issues in low-income housing by mobilizing public and private sector resources, and ensure the greatest extent feasible that job training, employment, and contracting generated by this grant will be directed to low-income households. All settlement-funded low-income programs must be officially recommended by the EEAC and approved by the PSC. The Delaware Public Service Commission approved Delmarva Power's low-income settlement distribution plan at a hearing on May 22, 2018.  The RFP for the money manager was issued and should be selected in May 2019.  Funds will be disbursed in the next 2-3 years.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In 2016, the Evaluation, Verification, & Measurement subcommittee of the EEAC reviewed net-to-gross ratios, avoided costs, and net environmental impacts for low-income energy customers. The EM&V Committee recommended a proposed net-to-gross ratio for low-income programs to be 1. This includes income-eligible HES, low-income multi-family, and low-income new construction programs.

The EM&V Committee in 2016 recommended specific non-energy benefits for low-income programs. These non-energy benefits include weatherization reduced arrearages and participant health and safety benefits. Specific values were also applied to non-energy benefits and are locked in for three years. These non-energy benefits were unanimously recognized and approved by the EEAC.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) administers federal weatherization funds, which are coordinated and joined with federal LIHEAP block grant, state utility funds, and funds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).

The Low-Income Energy Efficiency Committee of the EEAC began meeting in 2016 with a purpose to develop cost-effective low-income programs to submit before the EEAC. It is made up of stakeholders from the EEAC, utility representatives, state agencies, community action agencies, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, and community foundations. In an effort to better serve the low-income population in the state, the committee was tasked with identifying existing services that provide funding for affordable housing. Some of the existing programs identified include the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), SHARING Fund, Beat the Peak, and Assisted Home Performance with Energy Star.

The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility collaborate in order to deliver services to as many clients as possible.  The Delaware Pre-Weatherization Program (Pre-WAP) is a unique initiative developed in order to serve clients that would otherwise be deferred by WAP due to the condition of the client’s home.  The Pre-Weatherization program helps low-income families in Delaware prepare their homes to meet the requirements for the State of Delaware’s Weatherization Assistance Program.  Many potential Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) clients cannot afford the structural home repairs needed to qualify the home, and therefore lose the ability to participate in weatherization assistance.  Participants whose properties have been deferred by WAP for structural reasons are referred to Energize Delaware’s Pre-Weatherization Program.  Energize Delaware provides funding to pay for the repair of the structural issues, such as leaky roofs, broken windows and doors, or moisture in crawl spaces.  The Pre-Weatherization Assistance Program will inspect homes, hire contractors, schedule repair work, and perform a quality assurance post-inspection, then re-admit these units into the Weatherization Assistance Program.  Over 200 homes have been completed to date at an average cost of $3,000 per home.  Participants in the LIHEAP are also referred to WAP for additional services.

","Passed in 2006, HB 80 required the creation and implementation of a state building energy efficiency program, which shall develop guidelines/procedures and goals for energy efficiency for state buildings. The program must also analyze and benchmark state agencies' energy consumption. In the past 12 months, DFCM has gotten the first round of data entered into a state-wide (all state agencies buildings) data base, Building OS, in order to start bench-marking state buildings. The intention now is to bench-mark state buildings against the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data set. The other goal for the Building OS platform is confirm that buildings are performing in accordance with their design intent, and thereby confirm and inform the effectiveness of the State's High Performance Building Standard. Data continues to be added to the Building OS platform, and part of the bench-marking data availbale is on another platform that many higher education institutions have chosen called Vitality. These two data sets re being used to created state specific EUI design targets for certain types of buildings. The comparison to CBECS will aslo continue as another way of assessing energy performance. Currently, 60% of DFCM managed buildings are being bench-marked in Building OS. This does not include higher education or other public buildings. The City of Salt Lake has its own bench-marking program underway.

In Spring 2015, the Utah Governor's Office of Energy Development, CFSM, Division of Administrative Services, and Salt Lake City Public Schools began very early discussions to develop a statewide benchmarking, challenge and recognition program. S.B. 217 (2015) requires all state buildings to report their utility expenditures and energy and water consumption annually at the building level and report to the Governor and Legislature annually. Each state agency must designate a staff member that is responsible for coordinating energy efficiency efforts within the agency; provide energy consumption and costs information to the division; develop strategies for improving energy efficiency and reducing energy costs; and provide the division with information regarding the agency's energy efficiency and reduction strategies. As part of this initiative, the Division of Facilities Construction and Management are identifying structures that require building-level meters and are working to meter those buildings in order to fulfill the reporting requirements. The Utah Division of Facilities Construction and Management estimates that 15 percent of state government building square footage is benchmarked. A standard of quality and a method of centralized reporting are being established in FY 2017. The Utah Division of Facilities Construction and Management released an RFP for a vendor to meter buildings and develop an online benchmarking platform. The vendor has been selected and the scope of work is being executed.

The Division of Facilities, Construction and Management has a self-authored High Performance Building Standard (HPBS) that requires all State funded and managed new construction projects to achieve a 20% energy cost savings over a code baseline. This standard is currently under review with the intent the requirement in the future will be more stringent.

In addition, HB110 (March 2007) “State Fleet Efficiency Requirements” is intended to accomplish three goals: (1) reduce fleet costs or increase energy efficiency; (2) improve air quality by decreasing the carbon output from state vehicles; and (3) reduce the state’s dependence on foreign oil. It requires agencies that use state fleet vehicles to design programs that will reduce fleet costs by increasing energy efficiency through decreasing the volume of fuel used, increasing fleet mpg, and implementing improved maintenance of vehicles, among other approaches. As part of H.B. 110, the Utah State Fleet works to reduce fleet operation's vehicle count, reduce operating costs, and increase total miles per gallon (MPG). Utah's FY2017 report describes the state's progress. The Division of Fleet Operations has replaced 873 older vehicles with more fuel efficient models, including hybrid, bi-fuel, and tier 3 vehicles. Currently, there are 12 e-bikes in operation within State Fleet across 6 agencies. This is part of the State’s efforts in decreasing short-trip vehicle emissions by providing this zero emission alternative transportation to State employees.

Division of Fleet Operations’ Motor Pool section has successfully begun a pilot program with six agencies to test telematics across the State of Utah and various vehicle use types. The pilot consists of approximately 1,100 units that will capture a range of vehicle data that will help managers make better decisions to improve efficiency across their vehicles.

","Utah’s ESPC work was initiated by legislation – the Quality Growth Act of 1999 – directing Utah to undertake “aggressive programs to reduce energy use in state facilities in order to reduce operating costs of government and to set an example for the public.”

Following an executive order in 2006 by Governor Jon Huntsman that called for an increase in energy efficiency in state buildings, the use of ESPCs exploded in Utah as a means of attaining these goals. The Division of Facilities Construction and Management (DFCM), in partnership with the Governor's Office of Energy Development, maintains a prequalified list of ESCO through a cooperative contract with State Purchasing allowing this list to be used by all public entities across the State. The Division of Facilities Construction and Management, in partnership with the Governor's Office of Energy Development is, in complement to this existing contract, developing a pre-qualified list of third-party reviewers to represent public entities in the review of ESCO services offered. Within DFCM, the State Building Energy Efficiency Program (SBEEP) is the primary entity in the state that assists with all forms of energy efficiency improvements (including ESPCs). SBEEP oversaw the selection of prequalified ESCOs to provide services in the Energy Performance Contract Program (EPCP) and allow interested agencies and institutions to bypass the solicitation and selection process, thereby expediting ESPC processes and cost recovery. This program now focuses on K-12 school districts, municipal facilities, large state universities, and college campuses. In addition, the Governor's Office of Energy Development and energy performance contracting stakeholders agreed to reinstate the Utah Chapter of the Energy Services Coalition to raise awareness and educate stakeholders about energy performance contracting opportunities.

The Governor's Office of Energy Development (OED) and Division of Facilities Construction and Management (DFCM) successfully established a new, pre-approved list of of third party reviewers for energy savings performance contracting (ESPC). The list complements a pre-approved list of energy savings companies and fills a gap identified by ESPC end users. The national Energy Services Coalition, State Liaison Team conducted a three-part survey with OED and DFCM to evaluate their approaches to Guaranteed Energy Savings Performance Contracting (GESPC). Overall, the ESC found that Utah fulfills the majority of metrics for a successful GESPC program, including a contract terms of up to 20 years and a requirement that energy savings companies guarantee savings. There are presently seven vendors on the pre-qualified list.

As part of the new ESC Utah Chapter efforts, OED is working with the members to establish contract templates to streamline project development and contract negotiations. Templates will be created for each phase of a project, from the Request for Proposal stage through project closing. The intent of the templates is to simplify the process for end users who may not have in house resources to effectively evaluate performance contracting projects.

Utah's pilot study was performed in two phases. The focus of Phase 1 was for the state and 10 local jurisdictions to gain experience conducting an evaluation of this type, and derive an initial assessment of energy code compliance. Concurrently with Phase 1 of their study, Utah developed a Utah Energy Code Compliance Roadmap to illustrate the best path forward for increasing energy code compliance in the state. For the Phase 2 study, 42 new residential buildings were evaluated across 22 jurisdictions, based on a random sample of homes generated by the State Sample Generator. To save time, each code inspector attempted to complete a 4-way inspection ,which looks at rough framing, rough plumbing, rough heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC), and rough electrical.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: A new compliance study will be undertaken in 2019. In late 2018, the U.S. Department of Energy selected Institute for Market Transformation's proposal to evaluate residential energy code compliance in Utah and Arizona. The Utah Governor's Office of Energy Development is partnering with IMT, and energy code compliance findings from the study will be incorporated into Utah's energy code training program.
	Utility Involvement: The utility demand-side management programs support building energy code compliance by offering incentives on energy code compliant equipment (where code applies). Since the Public Service Commission has approved those offerings there are indirect regulatory guidelines that enable the utilities to support energy code compliance. The utilities both provide cost-match funds for energy code training.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: Utah established the Uniform Building Code Commission to review and provide recommendations to the state legislature in the adoption of building codes. As part of its process, the Uniform Building Code Commission holds public hearings to gather public input on energy code adoption decisions. The UBCC meets on a monthly basis and through its Education Committee, supports a variety of associations throughout the state focused on training and improving compliance.

Utah's rules for interconnection include provisions for three levels of interconnection for systems up to 20 MW, based on system complexity. Interconnection requirements, standards and review procedures are divided into three tiers. While CHP is not specifically defined as an eligible technology, the regulatory rules are interpreted as applicable to all electric generation resources.

The incentive itself can be up to a 100% credit of new state taxes over the life of the project.

Net Metering: Utah law requires their only investor-owned utility, Rocky Mountain Power (RMP), and most electric cooperatives to offer net metering to customers who generate electricity using renewables. Systems that use waste gas and waste heat capture or recovery are eligible. Net metering is available for residential systems up to 25 kilowatts (kW) in capacity and non-residential systems up to two megawatts (MW) in capacity. HB 145 of 2010 broadened the definition of a customer generation system to remove a requirement that the system be owned or leased by the utility customer.

",6.5 out of 20,"Utah's utilities administer and implement a portfolio of energy efficiency programs as required by the Utah Public Service Commission as part of integrated resource plans, in place since 1992, that are filed biennially by the utilities and include demand-side resources and associated programs. Utility energy efficiency program investments and energy savings have been above the national average in recent years, however Rocky Mountain Power, which serves around 80% of Utah's population, recently decided to scale back its energy efficiency programs starting in 2018.

In 2009, Utah passed legislation (House Joint Resolution 9) calling for Utah's electric utilities to reduce the state's energy consumption by 1% annually. The bill also calls for natural gas utilities to save 0.5% annually. It encourages the use of “all available cost-effective energy efficiency.”

In September 2009, the PSC approved RMP’s request to increase its utility bill surcharge to pay for demand-side management (DSM) programs to 4.6%. Utah’s main natural gas utility, Questar Gas (Dominion Energy), began implementing efficiency programs in 2007. Questar's CET decoupling mechanism was changed from a pilot program to ongoing in 2010. Questar combined with Dominion Energy in 2016.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Utah has been a southwest leader in utility energy efficiency programs in recent years, however these savings experienced a significant decline in 2018 following Rocky Mountain Power's decision to cut funding towards programs.

RMP (PacifiCorp), administers and provides a portfolio of energy efficiency programs as part of its integrated resource planning. The Utah Public Service Commission (UPSC) reviews and approves these plans and associated program plans and budgets. Electric efficiency programs are funded through a tariff rider on customer bills, as allowed under Utah Code Section 54-7-12.8(2), which states that the commission may approve a tariff under which an electrical corporation includes a line item charge on its customer bills to recover the costs incurred by the electrical corporation for demand-side management. RMP's utility bill surcharge varies by rate schedule, and the current rates effective January 1, 2019, can be found at this link.

Dominion, the only natural gas utility regulated by the UPSC, also administers energy efficiency programs. In 2006, the UPSC approved the Conservation Enabling Tariff (CET), allowing Dominion to collect a fixed revenue-per-customer on a monthly basis in exchange for promoting customer energy efficiency programs, demand-side management (DSM) programs, and a low-income assistance program. Dominion provides a wide range of energy efficiency programs for residential and business customers.

","The PSC’s integrated resource planning requirements were established in the 1990s (1992 for PacifiCorp and 1994 for Dominion). PacifiCorp files a biennial integrated resource plan which include demand-side resources and associated programs. From the IRP guidelines, “The [IRP] process should result in the selection of the optimal set of resources given the expected combination of costs, risk and uncertainty” (Standard and Guidelines, 1. Definition). Also, PacifiCorp’s IRPs must include “An evaluation of all present and future resources, including future market opportunities (both demand-side and supply-side) on a consistent and comparable basis” (Standards and Guidelines, 4.b.). Dominion files its IRP annually.

In 2009, the Utah Legislature passed House Joint Resolution 9 (HJR9) that, among other things, supports: 1) cost-effective energy efficiency and load management programs for Utah's electric utilities, 2) an electricity savings goal for RMP to reduce projected electrical sales by not less than 1 percent of its annual retail sales: and 3)a  natural gas savings goal for Dominion to reduce natural gas sales by not less than 0.5% of its annual retail sales.  HJR9 also encourages various government and corporate entities to recognize energy efficiency as a priority resource and to promote “all available cost-effective energy efficiency.”

In March 2016, the Utah State Legislature passed Senate Bill (SB) 115, the ""Sustainable Transportation and Energy Plan Act"" (STEP). STEP authorizes Rocky Mountain Power to implement a combined line-item charge on customer bills to recover DSM-related costs and to capitalize and amortize these costs over a 10-year period. The bill creates a ""Regulatory Liability Fund,"" which can be used to depreciate thermal generation plant for which the Utah PUC determines depreciation is in the public interest for compliance with an environmental regulation or another purpose and to offset capitalized DSM costs. STEP also relieves certain customers of the obligation to pay for DSM. 

In March 2019, the Utah State Legislature passed House Bill 107 and amendment to the STEP legislation creating a similar STEP program for Dominion Energy. The program authorizes a gas corporation to establish natural gas clean air programs that promote sustainability through increasing the use of natural gas or renewable natural gas that the commission determines are in the public interest. Specifically the following may be approved: (i) an economic development incentive rate; (ii) research and development of other efficiency technologies; (iii) an acquisition of nonresidential natural gas infrastructure behind the large-scale natural gas utility's meter; (iv) the development of communities that can reduce greenhouse gases and NOx emissions; (v) a natural gas renewable energy project; (vi) a commercial line extension program; or (vii) any other technology program.

Utah has no specific required spending or savings requirements for low-income energy efficiency programs. 

Rocky Mountain Power provides low-income weatherization services to income-eligible households through a partnership with the Utah Department of Workforce Services, Housing and Community Development Division (HCD). HCD receives federal funds and subcontracts with seven non-profit agencies that install energy efficiency measures in the homes of income-eligible households throughout Rocky Mountain Power's service area. Rocky Mountain Power's funding of 50% of the cost of approved measures is leveraged by HCD with the federal funding they receive, allowing more homes to be served each year. Services are at no cost to the program participants.

Dominion annually provides $500,000 of low-income ratepayer-funded assistance delivered through a partnership with the Utah Department of Workforce Services, Housing and Community Development Division. It is targeted at replacing inefficient furnaces for income-qualified households. In addition, an approved non-profit or governmental organization may apply for rebates under the ThermWise Appliance and Weatherization programs for qualifying measures listed in § 2.10 and §2.14 of the Tariff.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Docket No. 09-035-27. Utah uses the total resource cost (TRC) test, utility cost test (UCT), participant cost test (PCT), and ratepayer impact measure (RIM). Approval of individual DSM programs or portfolios of programs should be based on an overall determination that the program or portfolio is in the public interest after consideration of all five tests and the passage of the threshold test, the UCT. In addition, Utah also utilizes the PacifiCorp TRC (PTRC) test, which follows the Northwest convention of adding 10% to the avoided costs to account for unquantified environmental and transmission and distribution impacts.

Dominion follows the California Standard Practice Manual. Questar Gas Company's requirements are identified in Docket No. 05-057-T01 (Questar was the gas utility name prior to merger with Dominion Energy). 

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Utah Division of Housing and Community Development administers the state's Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). Participating households average nearly 33% in savings, or approximately $285 per year, after the completion of weatherization improvements. To apply for weatherization assistance, individuals must submit their application to the agency that services the county in which they reside. Benefits are provided in the form of noncash grants to eligible households to make energy-efficiency improvements to those homes.
The HCD administers the program statewide through eight government and nonprofit agencies. Benefits are provided in the form of noncash grants to eligible households to make energy-efficiency improvements to those homes. Those agencies are: Bear River Association of Governments, Salt Lake Community Action Program, Housing Authority of Utah County, Six County Association of Governments, Five County Association of Governments, Uintah Basin Association of Governments, and Southeastern Utah Association of Local Governments, all of which qualify as approved non-profit or governmental organizations (HCD implementation agencies).

Charges appear on customer bills as “Customer Efficiency Services,” the funding source for cost effective energy efficiency and load management programs approved by the Commission and managed by PacifiCorp. Schedule 193 is a balancing account mechanism where revenues to fund the above programs are collected outside of general rate case proceedings.

On October 5, 2006, Questar Gas, now Dominion Energy Utah, was approved to implement a Conservation Enabling Tariff (CET) and Demand-Side Management (DSM) Pilot Program. The CET allows Distribution Non-Gas (DNG) revenues received by Dominion to be based on the number of customers rather than customers’ gas usage. This is considered to be a form of decoupling. On June 24, 2009, the Pilot Program was extended to operate until December 31, 2010 (PSC Docket No. 05-057-T01, October 2006). Dominion's CET decoupling mechanism was changed from a pilot program to ongoing in 2010 (See Order June 3, 2010, changing the status of the CET from a pilot to permanent).

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Iowa relies on regulatory orders (Iowa Administrative Code 199—35.5(2) (f)(476)). Evaluations are administered by the utilities. There are no specific legal requirements for these evaluations in Iowa. Evaluations are conducted statewide and for each of the utilities.

Iowa uses the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Utility/Programs Administrator (UCT), Participant (PCT), Social Cost (SCT), Total Resource Cost (TRC) and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM). The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Iowa Code §476.6(13) and IAC 199—35.8(2). Iowa specifies the SCT to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. These benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio, total program, customer project, and individual measure level screening, with exceptions for low-income programs, pilots, and new technologies. Iowa’s SCT test accounts for avoided environmental compliance costs.  

The current energy efficiency plans (EEP-2018-0002 - MidAmerican, EEP-2018-0003 - IPL, EEP-2018-0004 - Black Hills, and EEP-2018-0005 - Liberty) contains the EM&V plans for the 2019-2023 plan cycle.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Iowa relies on the Societal Cost Test (SCT) and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test.  However, Iowa rate-regulated utility customers may opt out of the five-year energy efficiency plan if a program does not pass the RIM test. Iowa’s SCT accounts for non-energy benefits such as asset value, natural gas savings, and appliance water savings. Iowa also accounts for avoided environmental costs. Low-income programs do not need to pass a cost-effectiveness test.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Iowa is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

In 2008, Florida Governor Charlie Crist approved House Bill 7135, which requires newly constructed or renovated buildings financed by the state to be designed and built to meet a nationally recognized sustainable building rating or national model green building code. Eligible rating systems include those established by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, the International Green Construction Code (IGCC), the Green Building Initiative’s Green Globes rating system, the Florida Green Building Coalition standards, or a nationally recognized, high-performance green building rating system as approved by the department. State agencies also must lease ENERGY STAR-rated buildings and employ energy saving performance contracts to upgrade existing facilities.

In 2008, the Florida Legislature passed the Florida Energy Conservation and Sustainable Buildings Act, directing state agencies to incorporate sustainable building practices into the design, construction, and renovation of state buildings. Through this act, the Florida Department of Management Services (FDMS) developed the Florida Life-Cycle Cost Analysis Program (Chapter 60D-4, Florida Administrative Code), which pertains to the evaluation of life-cycle energy performance for alternative building designs. Additionally, FDMS developed the State Energy Management Plan (SEMP), which is a comprehensive plan to help state agencies reduce energy consumption and costs. The SEMP includes the following: data-gathering requirements, building energy audit procedures, uniform data analysis procedures, employee education program measures, energy consumption reduction techniques, training for agency energy management coordinators, guidelines for building managers, and measures to reduce energy consumption in the area of transportation.

In 2012, House Bill 7117 passed modifying Florida Statutes Section 255.257 that included the reporting requirements on energy use by each building owned or leased for state business 5,000 square feet or more. The statute requires that agencies collect energy usage and cost data, but does not specify a tracking tool.

All State government-owned buildings larger than 5,000 square feet with air conditioned space report their energy usage to DMS for benchmarking, and this data is reported annually in the State Energy Management Plan Annual Summary Report.

Description: The Florida Public Service Commission adopted its interconnection standard in March 2008. The standards, which apply to distributed generation systems up to 2MW in size, delineate three separate tiers of interconnection based upon system size. The interconnection rule applies only to generation using renewable fuels, but includes waste heat in its definition of “renewable energy.” Some CHP systems may be interpreted as using “waste heat” as a primary fuel, but there is no wording that clearly defines CHP as eligible for interconnection using this standard.

It also applies to natural gas utilities whose annual sales volume is equal to or exceeds 100 million therms. This act requires each utility to implement cost-effective energy-efficiency programs and to conduct energy audits. It also includes improving the efficiency of generation, transmission and distribution systems.

The Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) reviews and approves utilities’ energy efficiency plans. According to FEECA, the FPSC may allow investor-owned utilities to earn an additional return on equity of up to 50 basis points for saving 20 percent or more of their annual load-growth via energy efficiency. No utilities have yet requested the additional return. The FPSC may also assess penalties if utilities do not meet the goals.

Specific electricity and peak demand savings goals were set for each of the seven ""FEECA utilities"" most recently in 2014 for 2015 through 2024, averaging 990.6 GWh annually. These goals are lower than those approved by the Commission in 2009.

","The 1980 Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA) requires utilities to implement cost-effective energy efficiency programs. The Commission establishes demand-side management (DSM) conservation goals for summer and winter demand (MW), and annual energy sales (GWh). The Commission, when establishing goals, places a strong focus on reducing the state's high peak demands. The Florida Public Service Commission reviews DSM goals for each utility at least once every five years and sets demand and energy sales goals that extend 10 years into the future. Within 90 days after the Commission issues its order approving a utility's DSM goals, that utility must file a plan with the commission for approval. The utilities are also required to file annual reports on their DSM programs.

Most of these DSM plans include residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. The utilities provide conservation education programs to their customers. They also typically offer incentives to encourage customers to install more efficient equipment. The utilities distribute the costs of the programs by adding a surcharge for all customers. The surcharge varies by utility.

Natural gas programs are available for residential and commercial customers in Florida and are required by both legislation and orders. Natural gas energy efficiency is required by the Florida Statutes (Section 366.81-82) and by FPSC Rule 25-17.009.

Investor-owned electric utilities may recover reasonable expenses, including customer incentive costs, for DSM programs approved by the Florida Public Service Commission. The utilities recover these costs by adding surcharges to customer bills. Also, the FPSC conducts Energy Conservation Cost Recovery (ECCR) proceedings each November and determines an energy conservation cost recovery factor to be applied to bills during the next year. This factor is based on each utility’s estimated conservation costs for the next year.

Wisconsin’s modified TRC accounts for environmental benefits from reduced emissions.  A benefit-cost test is required for overall portfolio level screening. Starting in 2019, Focus on Energy will be conducting a Societal Test as well as continuing to conduct TRC, UCT, and RIM tests.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Focus is required by statute and adminsitrative code to ensure it provides participation opportunities to all customers who pay in on their rates. While this requirement doesn't specifically mention low-income customers, those customers do pay into the program and in practice the general requirement has been interpreted to require the provision of programs for low-income residential customers. Further code support for serving low-income customers is provided by the fact that administrative code requires Focus to pass a portfolio-level cost-effectiveness test (with res and nonres portfolios). Again, while it does not specifically mention low-income, one of the established reasons for setting portfolio-level testing rather than program- or measure-level testing is specifically to ensure that low-income programs can be operated even if it is more difficult for them to reach program-level cost-effectiveness.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Commission Order Docket 5-FE-100, Ref #: 215245, final decision dated September 5, 2014, although no specific adjustments or exceptions to general cost-effectiveness rules are mentioned for low-income programs. Wisconsin uses a modified total resource cost (TRC) test that includes the value of emissions avoided through the program, including carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides. In addition, the commission also makes use of the utility cost test (UCT) and ratepayer impact measure (RIM).

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Wisconsin Department of Administration (DOA), Division of Energy, Housing, and Community Resources (DEHCR) administers Home Energy Plus (HE+) through a network of county agencies, tribal governments, community-based organizations, and housing authorities. HE+ includes the Wisconsin Home Energy Assistance Program (WHEAP), Home Energy Plus Furnace Program, and the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). Wisconsin’s WAP is funded with a combination of state and federal funds, including US Department of Energy (DOE), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP or EAP), and state Public Benefits (PB) funding. HE+ and DOA work with Focus on Energy staff to coordinate delivery and support Focus' own services to low-income customers.  For example, the parties meet regularly to share information, and Focus sometimes takes leads on customers who are on a waiting list for HE+ services.

Wisconsin’s management of federal, state, and utility funding is unique in that Wisc. Stat. §16.957 directs agencies to aggregate all funding streams into a single public benefit fund to coordinate distribution of assistance.

","While self-direct is available, no customer has taken this option—all participate in Focus on Energy instead. For self-direct, the customer must meet statutory definition of a large energy customer: has a monthly demand of at least 1 MW or 10,000 decatherms and a monthly utility bill of at least $60,000. Statute says that a customer may deduct the amount of program funding from the amount they must contribute to Focus through their utility, if/when they receive Commission approval for that program. By administrative code, any proposals for a customer to run such a program require an M&V plan, must pass a cost-effectiveness screening, and set and measure performance goals.

Nevada's renewable energy portfolio standard allows energy efficiency to be used in partial fulfillment of its portfolio requirements. Nevada utilities can recover lost revenues that result from successfully conducting energy efficiency programs.

The levels of funding and program services have grown rapidly since Nevada reestablished requirements for energy efficiency programs provided by the state's investor-owned electric utilities, as well as integrated resource planning. These utilities aggressively pursued energy efficiency and grew their portfolio until they achieved saving of 1.5% of sales in 2009. Since then their savings have dropped to half that amount. Nevada’s publicly-owned utilities also provide some energy efficiency programs to their customers.

In June 2017, SB 150 was signed into law directing the PUCN to establish annual energy savings goals for NV Energy and to establish performance-based incentives that an electric utility can recover if it exceeds those goals. 

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Summary: 25% renewable energy by 2025—energy efficiency may currently meet 20% of the standard in any given year, but phases out of the RPS over time.

In 1997, Nevada established a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) as part of its restructuring legislation. Assembly Bill (AB) 3 in 2005 revised the RPS, increasing the portfolio requirement to 20% by 2015 and allowing utilities to use energy efficiency to help meet the requirements. Amendments in Senate Bill 358 in 2009 raised the portfolio requirement to 25% by 2025. Energy efficiency measures qualify if they are subsidized by the electric utility, reduce demand (as opposed to shifting peak demand to off-peak hours), and are implemented or sited at a retail customer’s location after January 1, 2005. AB1 of 2007 expanded the definition of efficiency resources to include district heating systems powered by geothermal hot water. For years 2015 to 2019 not more than 20 percent of the RPS can be met utilizing energy efficiency. This amount drops to 10 percent for calendar years 2020 to 2024 before reducing to zero for 2025.

The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) established a program to allow energy providers to buy and sell portfolio energy credits (PECs) in order to meet energy portfolio requirements. The number of kWh saved by energy efficiency measures is multiplied by 1.05 to determine the number of PECs. For electricity saved during peak periods as a result of efficiency measures, the credit multiplier is increased to 2.0. PECs are valid for a period of four years. The PUCN currently has an open rulemaking regarding the annual savings goals in Docket Nos. 17-07011 and 17-08023.

In 2013, the legislature voted to phase out this energy efficiency allowance in order to effectively increase the requirement for new renewable energy.  

In June 2017, SB 150 was signed into law directing the PUCN to establish annual energy savings goals for NV Energy and to establish performance-based incentives that an electric utility can recover if it exceeds those goals.

	Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test  
	






	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test, participant cost test, societal cost test, and ratepayer impact measure
	



The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Nevada relies on statute (NRS 704.785(1)) and regulatory orders (NAC 704). The statute states that the Nevada Public Utilities Commission (PUCN) shall adopt regulations authorizing an electric utility to recover an amount based on the measurable and verifiable effects of the implementation by the electric utility of energy efficiency and conservation programs approved by the Commission. The Commission has taken this language to mean that M&V is mandated for energy efficiency programs. Evaluations are mainly administered by the utilities and are conducted for each program.

Nevada considers all of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC), the Utility Cost Test (UCT), the Rate Impact Measure (RIM), Participant Cost Test (PCT) and the Societal Cost Test (SCT). According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Nevada no longer uses a primary cost-effectiveness test, requiring utilities to choose a standard test that accounts for non-energy benefits. Utilities must submit a demand side plan that is cost effective as a whole. However, the TRC is the most commonly cost-effectiveness test used by utilities according to the DSESP,. . The TRC is called the NTRC when non-energy benefits are accounted for.

 

Nevada accounts for avoided environmental compliance costs, alternative fuel benefits, and water savings. Nevada accounts for economic development and jobs created by program. Nevada also includes other non-energy benefits such as increased customer asset value, productivity, economic well-being, comfort, health and safety, satisfaction, and low-income programs as non-energy benefit riders. These riders are included in the NTRC test and calculated with a proxy. Non- low-income programs, low-income programs, and combined programs use 10%, 25%, and 15% multipliers respectively.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Nevada is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP). Further information on health and environmental benefits is available in ACEEE’s Overview of State Approaches to Account for Health and Environmental Benefits of Energy Efficiency.

Nevada’s Energy Assistance Code specifies the UEC is 3.30 mills per therm of natural gas and 0.39 mills per kWh of electricity purchased by these customers.

NRS 702.270 requires that 25% of the money in the FEAC must be distributed to the Nevada Housing Division for programs of energy conservation, weatherization, and energy efficiency for eligible households. The Housing Division may use not more than 6% of the money distributed to it, pursuant to this section, for its administrative expenses.

In June 2017, SB 150 was signed into law, which, in addition to directing the PUCN to establish annual energy savings goals for NV Energy, also requires utilities to set aside devote a minimum 5% of efficiency program budgets for low-income customers..

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Regulations approving the multiplier methodology have been drafted but have not yet been approved by the Commission.

In 2008, the Commission adopted temporary rules pursuant to a 2007 law allowing gas utilities to propose decoupling their profits from their sales in a general rate case filed within one year of the approval of their energy efficiency programs. The rules specify a revenue-per-customer system for determining utility revenues to recover fixed costs. The PUCN adjusts this revenue on a per-class basis (i.e., “residential”) (PUCN Docket No. 07-06046 and Nevada Admin. Code 704.953). Gas utilities in Nevada can choose to either implement decoupling or use a performance.

In 2009 the Nevada Legislature passed SB 358, which directed the Commission to remove the financial disincentives faced by the utilities, and in 2010, the PUCN approved a Lost Revenue Adjustment Mechanism for electric utilities. The partial decoupling mechanism allowed utilities to recover ""lost revenues"" based on estimated savings through a third party M&V contractor during annual DSM filings. In 2015, the PUCN completed an investigation into an alternative lost revenue mechanism, and in Docket No. 14-10018, a new multiplier method was proposed by the electric utilities.

",3 out of 20,"North Carolina utilities have expanded energy efficiency programs in recent years. However, their levels of investment and performance still remain below the national average. Utility efficiency programs are likely to continue expanding given the recent efforts by utilities and stakeholders. In 2011, the newly-merged Duke Energy Progress (formed by two operating companies, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas) reached a South Carolina PSC-approved settlement agreement with clean energy groups that, among other things, sets an annual energy efficiency savings target of 1% of retail sales starting in 2015 and a 7% cumulative target from 2014 to 2018. Achievement of the target will require successful development, regulatory approval, and implementation of energy efficiency programs. North Carolina also allows energy efficiency to count toward its statewide renewable and efficiency standard. On February 29, 2008, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) issued final rules implementing legislation passed in August 2007 that created North Carolina’s renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard (REPS). The energy efficiency portion of the REPS energy savings targets increased to 0.75% of prior-year sales in 2012, rising to 5% of prior-year sales in 2021.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","Individual utilities now administer energy efficiency and renewable energy programs in North Carolina with oversight and approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC). In a 2011 South Carolina PSC-approved settlement agreement brokered between energy efficiency advocates and two merging utilities, Progress Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Carolinas, the merging utilities agreed to new energy efficiency programs and targets between 2014 and 2018. The Settlement Agreement, signed in December 2011, sets an annual energy efficiency savings target of 1% of retail sales starting in 2015 and a 7% cumulative target from 2014 to 2018 for each utility. PEC and DEC have operated their respective energy efficiency programs separately but have started to replicate some programs system-wide. Current cost-recovery mechanisms outlined in Docket No. E-7, Sub 1032, Docket No. E-2, Sub 931, and Docket No. E-22, Sub 464 include continuation of these goals. Duke Carolinas and Duke Progress may also earn a $400,000 incentive if they meet a goal of 1% incremental savings target.

Several municipal and cooperative utilities in North Carolina also administer customer energy efficiency programs.

In 2009, the NCUC approved Duke Energy Corp.’s Save-A-Watt program, which established energy efficiency goals and rate recovery for the utility. In August 2007, Session Law 2007-397 (Senate Bill 3) established the state’s first Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. This sets renewable energy and energy efficiency objectives for utilities. Each utility will submit a REEPS compliance plan to the NCUC, detailing its plans to achieve the required savings.

North Carolina Senate Bill 3 was finalized in 2008, introducing the state’s combined Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (REPS). Under REPS, public electric utilities in the state must obtain renewable energy power and energy efficiency savings of 3% of prior-year electricity sales in 2012, 6% in 2015, 10% in 2018, and 12.5% in 2021 and thereafter. For IOUs, energy efficiency is capped at 25% of the 2012-2018 targets and at 40% of the 2021 target. Co-operative and municipal utilities may satisfy all of their REPS requirement of 10% savings by 2018 with energy efficiency, excluding small set-asides for solar and other resources. Utilities demonstrate compliance by procuring renewable energy credits (RECs) earned after January 1, 2008. Under North Carolina Utility Commission rules, an REC is equivalent to 1 MWh of electricity generated by a renewable energy facility or avoided through an efficiency measure.

Since the REPS goals are cumulative, the 12.5% target in 2021 will require 5% of its sales in 2021 to be met with energy efficiency over the entire 13-year period in which energy efficiency savings may be counted. Averaged over three years, each target period until 2018 requires yearly incremental savings of 0.25%. The final period from 2018 to 2020 will allow yearly incremental energy savings of 0.83%. Utilities plan to employ more than the full quarter allowable over the next ten years. Industrial customers may opt-out of utility energy efficiency programs and not bear the costs of new programs if they implement their own programs. 

Each electric power supplier must file a REPS compliance plan for Commission review as part of its Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) filing on or before September 1 of each year. A utility’s IRP filing must include a comprehensive analysis of all resource options considered by the utility, including demand-side management and energy efficiency, which must result in “the least cost mix of generation and demand reduction measures achievable….”(N.C. Gen. Stat. §62-2(3a)).

In 2010, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) increased the goals from 20% of electric demand growth to 25% growth in demand in 2012 and 30% in 2013 and beyond, and later adopted S.B. 1125, which will eventually require utilities to meet EERS targets based on peak demand rather than growth in demand. While the goals have increased modestly in recent years, they are still far below most other EERS policies, and as a result, utility energy efficiency program investments and savings in Texas are below the national average.

To meet the efficiency goals, utilities administer incentive programs, which retail electric providers and energy efficiency service providers implement. Programs are typically funded through the utilities’ tariff or base rate. Utilities submit plans for the forthcoming year and reports on energy and capacity savings from the previous year to the PUCT. The PUCT approves the plans. Utilities receive performance bonuses based on their energy savings.

While the 2007 legislation required utilities to submit GWh savings goals to ensure they did not overly focus on load management, the PUCT determined that utilities could convert their demand savings goals into corresponding energy savings goals. In practice, however, the energy savings (MWh) resulting from Texas utility demand-response and energy efficiency programs are about twice the amount of the energy saving goals.

In 2010, the PUCT approved Substantive Rule § 25.181, which increased the goals from 20% of electric demand growth to 25% growth in demand in 2012 and 30% in 2013. The rule also established customer cost caps to limit efficiency expenditures. The cost caps may not affect every utility, but some have already hit the caps, which are inhibiting investment in cost-effective energy efficiency programs.

In the 2011 legislative session, Texas adopted Senate Bill 1125, which amends the EERS policy by requiring utilities to eventually achieve savings of 0.4% of each company’s peak demand. As a result, utilities with rapidly growing load growth will have more predictable and consistent goals than those that were set based on load growth. The Bill also added focus on reducing demand in the winter. The Bill does not remove the cost caps adopted in 2010.

Texas has no natural gas EERS.

Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: none




The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Texas relies on both legislative mandates (Senate Bill 1125) and regulatory orders. The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) hires an independent third-party contractor to perform evaluations.
In 2011, the Texas Legislature enacted SB 1125, which requires PUCT to develop an EM&V framework for effective program design and streamlined reporting. The EM&V framework is embodied in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.181, relating to Energy Efficiency Goal (see section P). The state maintains a Technical Reference Manual, which includes deemed savings values for energy efficiency measures.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Texas relies on the utility cost test (UCT) and considers it to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. Texas accounts for low-income programs, technologies, and pilots in a different cost-effectiveness test. A savings-to-investment ratio is used to assess low-income efficiency programs and component measures, and a societal discount rate of 3% is used. Only incentive costs are included and customer avoided energy costs are used as benefits.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Texas is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

As amended by SB 1434 in June 2011, Substantive Rule § 25.181 states “…each utility shall ensure that annual expenditures for the targeted low-income energy efficiency program are not less than 10% of the utility’s energy efficiency budget for the program year.”

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

In an Order adopted September 28, 2012, the commission directed that low-income programs would not be required to meet the cost-effectiveness standard in Substantive Rule § 25.181 but rather would only need to meet standards required by the Savings-to-Investment ratio (SIR) methodology. All measures with a SIR of 1.0 or greater qualifies for installation. The SIR is the ratio of the present value of a customer’s estimated lifetime electricity cost savings from energy efficiency measures to the present value of the installation costs, inclusive of any incidental repairs, of those energy efficiency measures.

All investor-owned utilities have a shared benefit incentive in place. When a utility exceeds its demand reduction goal within the prescribed cost limit, it is awarded a performance bonus. The performance bonus is based on the utility’s energy efficiency achievements for programs implemented in the previous year (PUCT Substantive Rule §25.181).

A utility that exceeds 100% of its demand and energy reduction goals shall receive a bonus equal to 1% of the net benefits for every 2% that the demand reduction goal has been exceeded, with a maximum of 10% of the utility’s total net benefits.

As part of EO 31, the Governor created a Chief Energy Efficiency Officer within the Administration to oversee aggressive implementation of EE measures in state agencies, and instructed executive agencies to engage/re-engage in the Energy Performance Contracting process. The 2014 Virginia Energy Plan includes a recommendation to ""create a central state facility energy data registry and dashboard to track energy consumption at all state agencies. The Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy created a pilot version of this data warehouse in early 2016 and started in late 2016 a two-year process to develop a full scale benchmarking program for all state buildings. A small percentage, around 5 percent, of the largest energy consumers in the state building fleet, had been benchmarked by the end of 2016 in the pilot referenced above.

EO 19 also directs that new or renovated state buildings should conform to LEED silver or Green Globes two-globe standards.  In addition, the order instructs the Commonwealth to encourage private sector adoption of energy-efficient building standards by giving preference when leasing buildings for state use to facilities meeting the above standards.

Executive Directive 2, signed by Governor McDonnell in 2011, directs three state agencies to create a plan to centralize energy management across state facilities to seek out economies of scale and greater energy efficiencies. This plan shall also encourage communications among agencies on energy best practices and educate state employees about how their actions affect state energy use and costs.

The state included in the 2014 Virginia Energy Plan (VEP) a goal to increase the number of natural gas, propane, and electric vehicles in state and local government fleets to 300 by the end of 2017. Virginia’s fleet conversion program directs up to $9 million in federal Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) and state matching funds to pay the incremental costs of these vehicles. Vehicles that receive this funding must be garaged in areas that do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, or particulate matter (nonattainment areas) and for former nonattainment areas that are now in compliance (maintenance areas). 

The Commonwealth also offers temporary “bridge” and long-term loans to state agencies and localities in both non-attainment and attainment areas, as well as loans for alternative fueling and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. These programs support the alternative fuel vehicle recommendation made by a working group of the Virginia Climate Change and Resiliency Update Commission.

Virginia Department of General Services includes in its policies and procedures guidelines for the purchase of fuel-efficient, low-emission state-owned vehicles, when practicable. Every state vehicle request begins as the smallest most fuel-efficient vehicle, and larger vehicles must go through additional justification documentation. In addition, DGS’s leasing vehicles guidelines encourage the use of compact, fuel-efficient, and low-emission vehicles.

Virginia passed its first mandatory EERS in 2020, replacing earlier voluntary goals. In March 2007, the Virginia legislature passed a bill amending Virginia’s earlier electric industry restructuring law. The governor approved the bill conditionally, requiring the addition of a section on energy conservation, including a goal of 10% electricity savings by 2022 (calculated relative to 2006 sales). The legislature accepted this condition. In 2015, Governor McAuliffe announced a revised goal of 10% electricity savings by 2020. However, a lack of regulatory requirements meant these energy savings goals were considered voluntary.

In April 2020, Governor Northam signed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, establishing an EERS for investor-owned utilities as part of the bill’s goal of reaching 100% clean energy by 2050.

The EERS requires that in 2025, Dominion must save electricity equivalent to at least 5% (relative to 2019 sales) via efficiency measures implemented that year plus ongoing savings from measures implemented in previous years that are still saving energy. Appalachian Power Company must achieve 2% electricity savings by 2025. Statewide it’s estimated these goals translate to incremental annual savings targets of about 1.2% per year, avoiding more than 7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over four years and continuing to reduce emissions as measures continue to save energy.

The bill also sets up a process to strengthen the EERS after 2025. After that year, the State Corporation Commission will adjust energy efficiency targets every three years. Utilities will also have to prove they are hitting those targets before they are permitted to build new fossil fuel plants.

Evaluations are mainly administered by the Virginia State Corporation Commission. Virginia has formal requirements for evaluation articulated in 20 20 VAC 5-304-10. Evaluations for each of the utilities are conducted.

Virginia uses four of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC), Utility/Programs Administrator (UCT), Participant (PCT), and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM). According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Virginia considers all four of these tests to be its primary cost-effectiveness tests. An energy efficiency program is considered to be “in the public interest” if the program provides measurable and verifiable energy savings to low-income and elderly customers.

Virginia adopted new rules in 2018 that a program or portfolio of programs shall be approved if the net present value of the benefits exceeds the net present value of the costs as determined by not less than any three of the four aforementioned tests. The benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio, total program, customer project, and individual measure level programs screening. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in 20 VAC 5-304-10.

In December 2008, Virginia Gas received approval to implement a three-year conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan. The plan has two main components: an Energy Conservation Plan (ECP) to promote conservation and efficiency and a Revenue Normalization Adjustment, Rider D (""RNA Rider"" or ""Rider""), which is a natural gas decoupling mechanism that provides for a sales adjustment to customers’ monthly bills. The ECP and RNA Rider became effective on January 1, 2009 (Docket No. PUE-2008-00060; December 23, 2008).

Virginia Code Section 56-585.1 provides for the recovery of revenue reductions related to energy efficiency programs. Dominion Virginia Power applied for recovery of lost revenues in a regular rate case as part of its application to continue its DSM riders. The Commission denied Dominion’s lost revenue recovery request because it determined that the company did not meet its “burden to establish that its proposed revenue reductions ‘occur[red] due to measured and verified decreased consumption of electricity caused by energy efficiency programs approved by the Commission…’” (emphasis in order). The Commission held that Dominion failed to provide “sufficient evidence for the Commission to measure and to verify that a specific amount of decreased consumption of electricity was directly caused by the CFL program.”

Revenue recovery is limited by any offsetting sales and subject to industry standard measurement and verification (Case No. PUE-2010-00084).

The 2007 legislation amending the state's earlier restructuring law called for the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) to open a proceeding to initiate the development and implementation of efficiency programs with incentives and alternative means of compliance to achieve such goals. The legislation also states that an electric utility may recover projected and actual costs of energy efficiency programs, including a margin recoverable on operating expenses, which is equal to the general rate of return on common equity. The SCC can only approve such recovery if it finds that the program is in the public interest (See Virginia Code Section 56-585.1).

CHP is also eligible for low-interest loans under the Missouri Linked Deposit Program administered by the Missouri State Treasurer’s office. Loan proceeds help grow and expand economic opportunity across Missouri. By reducing the interest rate on certain loans borrowers can use to improve their businesses, this program helps Missouri financial institutions better serve Missouri-based companies and agricultural operations. This program also provides funds for local governments to serve the interests of their constituents. Loans may be used for energy efficiency measures through building renovations, repairs and maintenance, or purchase of equipment and facilities for businesses, farming operations, and multifamily housing.

","Missouri has a number of additional supportive policies in place for CHP.

The Department of Energy is a formal engagement partner in DOE’s Packaged CHP Accelerator Partnership and is actively encouraging CHP packagers and solution providers to serve the Missouri territory via the eCatalog. The eCatalog is a public web-based tool that enables Missouri commercial and industrial businesses that would benefit from CHP to find pre-engineered and assembled systems from proven service providers. The eCatalog will serve in a powerful way to reduce the perceived risk associated with the performance of unknown (to them) technology. 

In partnership with Spire, the Department of Energy developed and hosted two summits focused on CHP resiliency for critical facilities. In total, over 200 facility managers, energy engineers, and administrators of hospitals, universities, correctional facilities, and nursing homes were provided with an understanding of CHP technologies, complimentary CHP assessment by the Midwest CHP TAP, and direct access to vendors of CHP solutions. With a focus on health care and correctional facilities, DE is proactively reaching out to potential CHP candidates, providing technical assistance, and facilitating connecting them with TAP and following through to conclusion. 

Additionally, the Department of Energy filed testimony before the Missouri Public Service Commission on behalf of CHP in Case Nos. ER-2014-0258, ER-2014-0370, ER-2016-0179, GR-2017-0215, EO-2018-0211, ER-2018-0145/0146, GR-2017-0215, GR-2017-0216, GR-2018-0013, and GR-2019-0077. These interventions resulted in dramatically improved Standby Service Rider tariffs in terms of structure, definitions, and transparency in Ameren Missouri and Kansas City Power & Light cases, as well as the development of a spreadsheet tool that customers can use to estimate what actual utility charges may be as a result of cogeneration, outreach by Liberty Utilities’ local gas distribution company, and the inclusion of CHP as a business custom measure in Ameren Missouri’s upcoming cycle of MEEIA programs.

Missouri voters approved the state’s Renewable Energy Standard (RES) law by passage of Proposition C on November 4, 2008. The RES required Missouri’s regulated electric utilities to meet defined percentages of total retail electrical sales by renewable resources starting in 2011. Renewable-fueled CHP is an eligible technology. If the CHP system uses in-state renewable fuels, the resultant electricity is eligible for a 1.25 multiplier. Renewable fuels and distributed energy, such as CHP, are also specifically eligible for funding through the Energy Loan Program. The Wood Energy Tax Credit allows individuals or businesses processing Missouri forestry industry residues into fuels a state income tax credit of $5 per ton of processed material (e.g., wood pellets).

The Missouri Comprehensive State Energy Plan includes specific strategies (1.1.5, 1.9.4, 3.6.1, 3.6.2) to advance CHP in Missouri including equal treatment of CHP with other energy efficiency measures by regulated utilities, examining CHP potential at existing and new state facilities, developing a statewide CHP potential study, and establishing cost-based standby service rates for CHP customers.

",2.5 out of 20,"Missouri began a major transformation in the scope and role of utility-sector energy efficiency programs in 2009 when the state enacted SB 376, the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA). Among its many provisions, it requires Missouri’s investor-owned electric utilities to capture all cost-effective energy efficiency opportunities. After some delays in the implementation of MEEIA, one of the state’s largest utilities launched a full suite of customer programs beginning in 2012, and the state’s other largest utility filed a 3-year program plan as required by MEEIA in 2013. In early 2016, the Commission approved MEEIA Cycle 2 DSM programs and DSIMs for Ameren Missouri, KCP&L, and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company.

Prior to the developments of the past 10 years, Missouri has historically had limited energy efficiency programs for utility customers. While fundamental rules have been in place since the early 1990s for integrated resource planning (IRP) and demand-side management (DSM), such rules had not yielded significant levels of utility spending on DSM programs. MEEIA and related commission orders have led to a rapid and large increase in utility energy efficiency programs.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","The Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act of 2009 (MEEIA) established a new standard in the state for electric utility investment in demand-side management. The Act directs the Missouri Public Service Commission to permit electric corporations to implement commission-approved demand-side programs proposed pursuant to this section with a goal of achieving all cost-effective demand-side savings. The Missouri PSC also completed a revision of its IRP rules in Case No. EX-2010-0254. MEEIA rules and IRP rules both requires demand-side and supply-side measures to be evaluated on an equivalent basis.

4 CSR 240-20.094(2) – Demand Side Programs:
    (A) For demand-side programs and program plans that have a total resource cost test ratio greater than one (1), the commission shall approve demand-side programs or program plans, and annual demand and energy savings targets for each demand-side program it approves, provided it finds that the utility has met the filing and submission requirements of 4 CSR 240-20.094(4)(B) and the demand-side programs and program plans— 
1. Are consistent with a goal of achieving all cost-effective demand-side savings;
2. Have reliable evaluation, measurement, and verification plans; and
3. Are included in the electric utility’s adopted preferred resource plan or have been analyzed through the integrated resource analysis required by 4 CSR 240-22.060 to determine the impact of the demand-side programs and program plans on the net present value of revenue requirements of the electric utility.
     (B) The commission shall approve demand-side programs having a total resource cost test ratio less than one (1) for demand-side programs targeted to low-income customers or general education campaigns, if the commission determines that the utility has met the filing and submission requirements of 4 CSR 240-20.094(4)(B), the program or program plan is in the public interest, and meets the requirements stated in paragraphs (3)(A)2. and 3.

	Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test  
	
	
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test
	




The evaluation, measurement and verification of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Missouri relies on 4 CSR 240-22.070(8), 4 CSR 240-3.163(7), and 4 CSR 240-20.093. Evaluations are performed by the utilities’ independent evaluators and are reviewed by the Missouri Public Service Commission’s EM&V auditor. Missouri uses two of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC) and utility cost test (UCT). The benefit-cost tests are required for portfolio and total program level screening.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Missouri specifies the TRC to be its primary test for decision making. Non-energy benefits can be included in the TRC if they result in avoided utility costs that may be calculated with a reasonable degree of confidence (4 CSR 240-20.092 (1) (II)). Economic well-being benefits for customers that could be included in the TRC include benefits such as increased property values, reduced operations and maintenance costs, and decreased water and sewage bills. Economic well-being benefits for the utility that can be included in the TRC include benefits such as reduced arrearage carrying costs, termination or reconnection costs, and customer collection calls and notices. Missouri’s TRC accounts for the net costs of program implementation and end-use measures for both the utility and customers. Low-income programs do not have to pass the TRC.

MEEIA Cycle 2 technical reference manuals (TRM) were approved as part of the stipulation and agreements approved for Ameren Missouri in Case No. EO-2015-0055, and for KCP&L and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company in Case Nos. EO-2015-0240 and EO-2015-0241, respectively. A statewide TRM was created in early 2017 for gas and electric measures through a collaborative process funded by a grant awarded to the Missouri Division of Energy of the Department of Economic Development. The statewide TRM has not yet been approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission.

Natural gas utilities use all five cost effectiveness tests as governed by 4 CSR 240-22.070(8) and 4CSR 240-20.093(8).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

While no legislation or regulations have been adopted to require a specific level of utility spending for low-income energy efficiency programs as reported by the PSC, the Commission has ordered a number of regulated utilities to include specified levels of funding for low-income weatherization programs in their rates. The Division of Energy requested this in cases to assure continuous funding levels rather than subjecting WAP funding to voluntary MEEIA programs.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Missouri specifies the total resource cost (TRC) test to be a primary test for cost effectiveness. The benefit-cost tests are required for portfolio and total program level screening, although state regulations for utilities allow for low-income programs to have a TRC ratio of less than one (4 CSR 240-20.094(2).

Section 393.1075.4 of Missouri Code also specifies that ""programs targeted to low-income customers or general education campaigns do not need to meet a cost-effectiveness test, so long as the commission determines that the program or campaign is in the public interest.”

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

The Division of Energy administers the state Weatherization Assistance Program and also receives utility weatherization funds from four investor-owned utilities to administer consistent with US DOE WAP guidelines pursuant to PSC rate case orders. These funds are awarded by the Division of Energy to local weatherization agencies at the same time as state WAP funds and are subject to the same quality control and monitoring procedures. Local agencies use a combination of the utility and state WAP funds to maximize cost-effective savings.

The four utilities with weatherization funds administered by the Division of Energy are: Ameren Missouri Electric , Ameren Natural Gas, Laclede Gas, and Liberty Gas. For the remaining utilities that administer their own WAP funds/programs, the utilities have contracts with the affected local WAP agencies that are the Division of Energy’s subgrantees and administer the federal WAP funds.

","Recovery of Lost Revenues: In 2011, the Missouri Public Service Commission promulgated rules that authorize utilities to file for recovery of lost revenues (See 4 CSR 240-3.163, 4 CSR 240-3.164, 4 CSR 240-20.093, and 4 CSR 240-20.094). In 2012, the Commission approved a demand-side investment mechanism that allows Ameren Missouri to collect $80 million in an annual revenue requirement (Case No. ER-2012-0166) for recovery of demand-side programs’ costs, recovery of fixed operating costs, and a future performance incentive award based on after-the-fact verified energy savings from the programs (See Case No. EO-2012-0142). KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO) has an investment mechanism that allows collection of an $18 million annual revenue requirement for recovery of demand-side programs’ costs, recovery of fixed operating costs, and a future performance incentive award based on verified energy savings. Lost revenues are recovered through a rider or tracker mechanism until the full amount, including carrying charges, is recovered.

The rule implementing SB 376 provides for more timely cost recovery of DSM program costs by allowing adjustments to the funds collected between rate cases. Prior to SB 376, implementation program costs were recovered over a 6-year period. The SB 376 rule allows a regulated electric utility to propose performance incentives that are based on net shared benefits from the DSM programs it implements. Any utility incentive component of a DSIM shall be based on the performance of demand-side programs approved by the commission in accordance with 4 CSR 240-20.094 and shall include a methodology for determining the utility’s portion of annual net shared benefits achieved and documented through EM&V reports for approved demand-side programs. Each utility incentive component of a DSIM shall define the relationship between the utility’s portion of annual net shared benefits achieved and documented through EM&V reports, annual energy savings achieved and documented through EM&V reports as a percentage of annual energy savings targets, and annual demand savings achieved and documented through EM&V reports as a percentage of annual demand savings targets. Utilities may also propose recovery of lost revenues as measured and verified through EM&V prior to recovery on a retrospective basis.

In early 2016, the Commission approved DSM programs and demand-side programs investment mechanisms (DSIM) for Ameren Missouri (Case No. EO-2015-0055), KCP&L (Case No. EO-2015-0240), and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (Case No. EO-2015-0241), which allow each utility to bill customers for estimated lost revenues due to the programs and to true-up the billed lost revenues as a result of energy savings determined through retrospective net-to-gross EM&V performed by each utility’s independent EM&V contractors and reviewed by the Commission’s EM&V auditor. Presently, there is no electric utility revenue decoupling in Missouri. Missouri Gas Energy has straight-fixed variable (SFV) rate design. Laclede Gas and Ameren Missouri Gas both have a weather-mitigated rate design that is similar to SFV in principle.

Performance Incentives:  The approved DSM programs and DSIMs for Ameren Missouri (Case No. EO-2015-0055), KCP&L (Case No. EO-2015-0240), and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (Case No. EO-2015-0241) also allow each utility to receive an earning opportunity determined after the completion of the 3-year plan period and to recover any approved earnings opportunity over a two-year period. The earnings opportunity amount for each utility is based upon the achievement of each DSM program relative to established performance metrics for the DSM program, which metrics are most commonly 3-year cumulative annual energy targets and/or 3-year cumulative annual demand savings targets. Actual 3-year cumulative annual energy and/or demand savings for programs are determined through retrospective net-to-gross EM&V performed by each utility’s independent EM&V contractors and reviewed by the Commission’s EM&V auditor.

In October 2017, the Commission promulgated 4 CSR 240-20.092 Definitions for Demand-Side Programs and Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms; revised 4 CSR 240-20.093 Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms and 4 CSR 240-20.094 Demand-Side Programs; and rescinded 4 CSR 240-3.163 Electric Utility Demand-Side Programs Investment Mechanisms Filing and Submission Requirements (now incorporated in revised 4 CSR 240-20.093) and 4 CSR 240-3.164 Electric Utility Demand-Side Programs Filing and Submission Requirements (now incorporated in revised 4 CSR 240-20.094).

","Financial incentive information for Tennessee is provided by the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE Tennessee). Information about additional incentives not present on DSIRE is listed here.

EmPower Tennessee Initiative: Through this initiative the state is working to reduce energy costs and consumption across state-owned and managed facilities by measuring and controlling energy use, investing in increasing energy efficiency and renewable power generation, and creating an operational environment of excellence. Of the state's approved $43 million budget for FY2016, over $37 million is dedicated to energy efficiency projects. The remainder will go to the procurement and implementation of a utility data management system and related energy management infrastructure.

Pathway Lending Energy Efficiency Loan Program (EELP): Pathway Lending's EELP provides Tennessee business and non-profit entities with below-market loans for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements. In 2017, Pathway Lending issued 30 loans on 44 applications received, resulting in 5,761,110 kWh of annual energy savings and $661,830 in estimated monetary savings due to utility reductions. 

Pathway Lending’s EELP will not cover loan fees but will finance all other loan costs, including assessments, design, equipment and installation. Any project that reduces utility consumption, across electric, gas, or water, may apply for financing through this program. The loans are designed to allow for energy costs savings derived from each project to provide the repayment of the loan. The EELP now offers up to six years of financing for qualified energy efficiency and renewable energy projects to Tennessee local governmental entities, including municipalities, counties, school districts and other similar public agencies. To be eligible for a loan, a governmental entity must have a complete third-party energy audit, assessment or vendor proposal that details estimated energy savings. The EELP is a collaborative effort between Pathway Lending, the State of Tennessee / Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).

","In 2015, the Tennessee General Assembly approved funding in the FY 2015-16 state budget for EmPower TN, Governor Bill Haslam's statewide “lead-by-example” strategy to reduce the state’s energy consumption and costs across state-owned and managed facilities through the implementation of energy efficiency projects and energy management systems and processes.  The appropriated budget is in excess of $43 million, with $37.5 million dedicated to energy efficiency (EE) projects and the remainder to the procurement and implementation of an enterprise utility data management (UDM) system and related energy management infrastructure.  The UDM system will collect energy cost and consumption data and allow for the analysis, tracking, reporting, comparison and benchmarking for every State facility. 

To maximize utility savings opportunities for State facilities, the State building energy management statutory responsibilities for State-owned and managed properties (Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 4-3-1012 and 4-3-1017-1019) were transferred from the Department of General Services (DGS) to TDEC OEP via Executive Order No. 63 on January 1, 2017. A new section, SFUM, was formed under OEP. In addition to the aforementioned statutory responsibilities, SFUM oversees the EmPower TN strategy to reduce energy consumption and costs across State-owned and managed facilities. The initiative includes (1) a portfolio of energy efficiency projects in varying stages of development and implementation and (2) the implementation of a UDM system and related metering infrastructure to manage the State’s utility bills and identify future opportunities for cost savings.

The UDM system is a uniform repository for utility costs and usage for all approximately 8,000 State-owned and managed facilities. Following a competitive solicitation process, the State approved a multi-year contract with EnergyCAP, Inc., to provide UDM Software as a Service with utility benchmarking and tracking capabilities. The system provides a means for end-users—such as State facility and utility managers, fiscal personnel, technical assistance providers, sustainability professionals, and SFUM team members—to gain actionable insights into utility data. SFUM has worked with 72 state agencies and public higher education institutions to configure the UDM system for all state-owned and managed facilities (approximately 97 million square feet of property). As of June 2019, a total of 12,767 utility meters have been created and associated with their respective facilities. Outreach to all 350+ utility providers is complete, with 100% of vendors having provided historical data and ongoing utility bills.

The UDM system includes integration with the State of Tennessee’s accounting system for general government agencies. This integration was completed in May 2019 and has increased operational efficiencies by reducing staff time spent keying and logging cost and consumption data. With the completion of accounts payable integration, all general government agencies' utility bills are automatically recorded in the UDM system, ensuring the highest possible data quality. Currently, over 500 end-users have access to their facility and energy data in the UDM system.

SFUM is required by statute to track and analyze utility cost and consumption data, including energy. All state agencies and public higher education institutions are required by statute to assist SFUM’s analysis. They do so by appointing a department coordinator or liaison who must provide SFUM with their organization’s energy usage data. SFUM has worked with 72 state agencies and public higher education institutions to configure the UDM platform for all state-owned and managed facilities (approximately 97 million square feet of property). As of June 2018, a total of 10,312 utility meters and 8,200 “cost centers” have been created and associated with their respective facilities. Initial outreach to all 348 utility providers is complete, with 94% of vendors having provided historical data and ongoing utility bills. The UDM contract includes integration with the State of Tennessee’s accounting system for state agencies. This integration will increase operational efficiencies by reducing staff time spent keying and logging cost and consumption data and the utilization of 50+ automatic “auditing” and/or “alarm” tools within the system.  Currently, 95 end-users of an estimated 300 have access to the UDM platform and are learning the accounts payable functions through the test environment.

The Office of the State Architect and the Department of General Services (DGS) have collaborated to develop the High Performance Building requirements (HPBr), which build upon the existing State of Tennessee Sustainable Design Guidelines, to provide an energy-efficient and consistent approach to new construction, renovation, and operation and maintenance of all state buildings based on industry best practices.

High Performance Building Requirements (HPBr)

The state’s High Performance Building Requirements (HPBr) require compliance with ASHRAE 90.1-2010 for all state facilities and higher education campuses. The HPBr includes a checklist to encourage energy performance above ASHRAE 90.1-2010, including total building performance, lighting power levels, daylight harvesting, vacancy sensors, and high efficiency HVAC. In accordance with TCA §12-3-905, the HPBr requires the purchase and installation of Energy Star equipment for all Energy Star eligible equipment types. The HPBr requires data centers with cooling systems be sub-metered downstream of the UPS, a requirement for achieving an Energy Star rating. The HBPr challenges the State’s project design teams to think holistically and use tools such as building modeling and life cycle cost analysis to compare, integrate and optimize various system options. The HPBr positions the State of Tennessee for success by integrating best practices for a lower total cost of ownership. The HPBr is for state facilities and public higher education campuses.

","Tennessee Code Annotated §4-3-1109 (Energy Efficient State Vehicles) establishes the goal that 100% of newly purchased passenger vehicles be energy-efficient vehicles or alternative fuel motor vehicles. An energy-efficient motor vehicle is defined as a passenger motor vehicle that is:

An alternate fuel vehicle as defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486);
	A flexible fuel vehicle (FFV) utilizing ethanol, biodiesel, or any other commercially available alternative fuel approved by the United States Department of Energy;
	A hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV);
	A compact fuel-efficient vehicle, defined as a vehicle powered by unleaded gasoline that has a United States EPA estimated highway gasoline mileage rating of at least twenty-five miles per gallon (25 mpg) or greater for the model year purchased;
	An electric vehicle (EV);
	A vehicle powered by natural gas; or
	A vehicle powered by ultra- low sulfur diesel fuel that meets Bin 5, Tier II emission standards mandated by the EPA and that has an EPA estimated highway mileage rating of at least thirty miles per gallon (30 mpg) or greater for the model year purchased.
As of June 30, 2018, the State owned 381 energy-efficient passenger motor vehicles, including 268 FFVs, 39 HEVs, 4 EVs, and 70 energy-efficient vehicles with an average highway fuel economy of at least 25 MPG. Included in these totals are 39 passenger vehicles that were purchased during fiscal year (FY) 2018, all of which were energy efficient. The State met its target goal of purchasing 100% energy-efficient passenger vehicles in FY2018.

Tennessee statute also requires that 25% of newly purchased passenger motor vehicles procured for use in areas designated by the EPA as nonattainment areas shall be hybrid-electric vehicles or vehicles powered by natural gas, provided that such vehicles and fueling infrastructure are available at the time of procurement and such vehicles are purchased at competitive prices. In the event that such vehicles or fueling infrastructure are not available at the time of procurement, the State may instead meet this mandate by procuring compact fuel-efficient vehicles.

In areas that are not designated by the EPA as nonattainment areas, the State shall ensure that at least 25% of newly purchased passenger motor vehicles are hybrid-electric vehicles, vehicles powered by natural gas, or compact fuel-efficient vehicles, provided that such vehicles are purchased at competitive prices. As of November 2018, the only area designated by the EPA as nonattainment in Tennessee is Sullivan County (Sullivan County does not meet the 2010 Sulfur Dioxide National Ambient Air Quality Standard).

However, TDEC OEP is aware of at least eight performance contracts which have either been contracted for construction or completed within the last five years, including: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Bradley County Schools, Cleveland Housing Authority, the City of Knoxville, Montgomery County, Williamson County Government, Williamson County Schools, and the City of Paris.

Additionally, the State of Tennessee has completed 32 projects through two separate contract efforts, with projected annual energy cost savings amounting to almost $10 million. The Tennessee Board of Regents, which is the Supervisory Board for State universities outside of the University of Tennessee system, community colleges, and vocational-technical schools, has completed 17 ESPC projects since 2004, totaling $54 million in investment. The annual projected savings for these projects was $6.8 million.

In May 2018, the Tennessee legislature passed legislation acknowledging that State procurement agencies may enter into performance contracts for energy savings for State-owned buildings and facilities through alternative procurement or contracting vehicles. The legislation also encourages up to five pilot projects. This bill amended TCA Title 4 and Title 12.

Also in May 2018, the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis signed a contract for a $5.5 million ESPC project. This is the first phase of a planned $30 million project to overhaul the campus’ energy and plant equipment. Construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2019. Additionally, in March 2018, Williamson County initiated a multi-phase ESPC project for upgrades to their county buildings and facilities. In January 2019, Williamson County signed the first phase of the contract ($18M) to begin construction, which it is anticipated to be completed in early 2020.

","Tennessee’s energy efficiency research and development field comprises a variety of contributors, including several higher education institutions as well as a national laboratory. More information on these efforts follows.

The University of Tennessee - Knoxville (UT-Knoxville)

UT-Knoxville has a strong partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which collaborates with other state stakeholders and industry members, including the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), on energy research. The University of Tennessee Research Foundation (UTRF) also promotes the commercialization and deployment of advanced technologies, some of which are related to energy efficiency.

UT-Knoxville hosts several educational energy exhibits and infrastructure projects on its campus and various properties, serving as student and faculty tools for both public outreach and academic research. In December 2018, State and local leaders gathered to celebrate the opening of the I-40 Solar Farm Information and Welcome Center in Haywood County. On display is an interactive exhibit designed by UT-Knoxville, SPECTRUM, which highlights advancements in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The facility, designed by Memphis firm ANF Architect and funded by TDEC OEP, also features a nearly 360-degree view of the surrounding 5 MW, 25-acre West Tennessee Solar Farm, which surrounds the building.

Additionally, a solar array installed in April 2015 on a UT-Knoxville parking garage has proven to make the campus more energy efficient and continually serves as a research tool for students seeking to develop and study next generation renewable energy technologies. Research on this array and the efficiency impacts of on-campus power generation will continue for at least the next few years.

The Center for Ultra-Wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks (CURENT) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center, led by UT-Knoxville, that is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation and U.S. DOE. Partner higher education institutions include Northeastern University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Tuskegee University. CURENT's research focuses on improvement in grid transmission efficiency, better accommodation of renewable energy sources, full utilization of energy storage, and accommodation of responsive load. CURENT’s main project is to contribute to a nationwide transmission grid vision that will be fully monitored and dynamically controlled in real-time for high efficiency, high reliability, low cost, better accommodation of renewable energy sources, full utilization of energy storage, and accommodation of responsive load. CURENT partners, including the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga, ORNL, National Instruments, EPRI, TVA, and Green Energy Corp, will work to assist in project implementation and eventual commercialization.

The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) is a public-private partnership led by UT-Knoxville that focuses on advanced fiber-reinforced polymer composites, which combine strong fibers with tough plastics to cost-effectively manufacture materials that are lighter and stronger than steel. IACMI is supported by a $70 million commitment from DOE and a $189 million commitment from IACMI's partners (including Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Vanderbilt University, and more). IACMI has also received a $15 million commitment from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development as part of an effort to facilitate local breakthroughs in energy-efficient manufacturing and materials. Established by UTRF as a Tennessee-based nonprofit 501(c)(3), IACMI houses more than 170 members and continues to overcome barriers to the use of advanced composites through the development of low-cost, high-speed, and energy-efficient manufacturing and recycling processes. Through this work, IACMI will focus on lowering the production cost of advanced composites by 25%, reducing the energy used to make composites by 50%, and increasing the recyclability of composites to over 80% within 10 years.

Of IACMI’s 55 active research and development projects, 9 have been completed, 15 are in process, and 31 are in review. See a full list of IACMI’s energy efficiency projects at https://iacmi.org/active-projects/.

","State building codes adoption and enforcement efforts fall under the purview of the State Fire Marshal’s Office within the Department of Commerce and Insurance (C&I). Any changes to building energy code must comply with the state’s rule-making procedures. On November 2, 2015, C&I conducted a rulemaking hearing to adopt the 2009 IECC for residential one and two family dwellings and townhouses. The permanent rules were filed with the Secretary of State on November 4, 2016 and went into effect on February 2, 2017.

However, because Tennessee is a “home rule” State, significant variation exists in codes adoption and enforcement at the local level. Under Tennessee statute, all local jurisdictions must adopt a residential energy code that is within seven years of the most recently published energy code. However, all local jurisdictions may also opt out of adoption with a two-thirds majority vote of the local governing body. In addition, local jurisdictions cannot be required to adopt a local code that is more stringent than the one adopted by the State, but they may voluntarily choose to adopt an updated code version. If opting out, the vote must be completed after each local election cycle. To date, 86 jurisdictions have opted in to the state residential building code (apply the statewide building code to their jurisdiction and utilize the state’s building permit system and building inspectors), 80 jurisdictions have opted out (building codes are not recognized nor enforced), and 264 jurisdictions are exempt (building codes are adopted locally, meeting or exceeding the statewide standard; exempt jurisdictions hire their own inspectors and all paperwork is administered locally and audited on a 3 year cycle).

The State began implementation and enforcement of adopted energy codes for new building projects in July 2011. The State Fire Marshal’s Office requires a State building permit for new residential and certain commercial construction in areas of the State, except those where an exempt local government is enforcing a residential or commercial building code itself or where the local government has notified the Department it has opted out of the law. Building construction projects subject to code enforcement by the State Fire Marshal’s Office are required to obtain a State building code permit prior to commencing construction. The Department verifies contractors' licensure as part of the permitting process.

According to C&I, a number of local jurisdictions have adopted building energy codes that exceed versions adopted by the State. TDEC OEP is aware of at least 109 local jurisdictions that have already adopted the 2012 Residential IECC, and 11 that have adopted the 2015 IECC.

The Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance (SEEA) and its partner, Southface, are leading the initiative, which is funded by a U.S. Department of Energy award to SEEA.  This study will focus on a sample of single-family homes in the two climate zones in Tennessee and will identify the residential building energy code sections for which the State may wish to consider conducting additional education, outreach, and/or training.  The kickoff meeting was held in March 2017, and the study is expected to be completed in FY2018.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: the State of Tennessee, through TDEC OEP, C&I, and TFACA, is participating in a residential energy code compliance baseline field study. The Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance (SEEA) and its partner, Southface, are leading the field study, which is funded by a U.S. Department of Energy award to SEEA. This study will focus on a sample of single-family homes in the two climate zones in Tennessee and will identify the residential building energy code sections for which the State may wish to consider conducting additional education, outreach, and/or training. The project is approximately 75% complete and will be submitted to DOE for final review in the summer of 2018.
	In addition, under state regulations, the State Fire Marshal’s Office is granted authority to audit local exempt jurisdictions every three years, in order to check that they are enforcing codes correctly.  Tennessee plans to complete an audit and see that local jurisdictions are within seven years of the most recently published code. Audits for commercial buildings include a plan review and inspection of a small sample of buildings (would not be considered a statistically representative sample). Approximately 90 jurisdictions are audited each year.
	Utility Involvement: The State Fire Marshal’s Office has not established utility commission regulatory guidelines.  The Tennessee Public Utility Commissioner (formerly Tennessee Regulatory Authority) does not regulate the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the federally-owned corporation that provides electricity to approximately 99.7% of the electricity service territory in Tennessee.)
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: The State Fire Marshal’s Office has met with the Southeastern Energy Efficiency Alliance (SEEA) several times over the past several years to discuss building energy codes and enforcement. SEEA has offered to provide assistance and advice for adopting new codes and to influence energy code stakeholders.There is no established timetable for meetings. They are convened on an as-needed basis.
	Training/Outreach: 
	In addition to adoption and enforcement of building energy codes, C&I provides training and continuing professional education courses to codes inspectors across the State through the Tennessee Fire and Codes Academy (TFACA). In 2013, the TDEC Office of Energy Programs (OEP) / State Energy Office provided $195,000 in grant funding to C&I to develop a 2012 IECC training program for inspectors. OEP also provided C&I the opportunity to participate in 2012 IECC “train-the-trainer” courses administered by Southface Energy Institute. The grant funding allowed C&I to purchase equipment and gain the knowledge necessary to provide training to codes inspectors across the State.
		Following the grant period in 2013, C&I offered several free training opportunities to codes inspectors in all regions of the State. Classes were hosted at TFACA campus in Bell Buckle, offered in jurisdictions throughout TN, and plans have been discussed to offer online training for participants who are unable to attend the classes. Stephen Snow, TFACA Codes Enforcement Program Director, noted that the training program was extremely successful in its initial outreach, then requests for the training slowed for a couple of years once jurisdictions decided to adopt or not.  But recently due to the State requirement for jurisdictions to adopt an edition of the IECC that is always within 7 years of the latest printed edition, TN jurisdictions are once again exploring which viable edition they will adopt.
		
		A couple of instances provide evidence for this trend.  Early in 2016, the town of Cookeville requested that TFACA come and provide training to approximately 40 of their local contractors which the town assembled for the sole purpose of learning the requirements of IECC.  In February 2016, the East TN Building Officials Association asked the Academy to hold IECC – DET training for approximately 130 inspectors and building officials in their region to help their inspectors understand and implement IECC testing requirements.  As interest in IECC adoption and enforcement increases, TFACA will create more IECC courses throughout the State to move out of “introductory” training and into more “topic-specific” training.
		
		
		The most recent course offering was the IECC course presented by TFACA which was requested by the Tennessee Building Officials Association and which was presented at their State-wide conference.  At this event, inspectors from all parts of TN gathered to hear the Academy’s training on the 2018 IECC.  Many jurisdictions are posed to adopt the 2018 edition, and their representatives in that class were very receptive to the information presented.
		
		
		Also, TFACA and the SFMO have been exploring implementation of a comprehensive program to incorporate “distance learning” which will change the way all Academy training will be offered, including IECC course delivery. This online training will reach more individuals and small groups of officials within jurisdictions whose strict budgets have traditionally precluded travel to the TFACA campus for this material.  While more jurisdictions have adopted the 2012 IECC through the support of Academy IECC training, new inspectors joining these departments will be more easily trained in the use of the code, and will still have access to the resources the Academy can provide to support that training.  SFMO and TFACA officials are optimistic about the benefit this new medium will bring to inspectors in TN, and will have a variety of online presentation methods and testing options to insure students of TFACA distance learning are properly equipped to enforce the most current and viable editions of the IECC.

",2 out of 3,"The state offers financing assistance for some CHP projects and has identified CHP as a resource to improve energy system resilience. Two new CHP systems came online in Tennessee in 2018.
","Policy: Tennessee Interconnection orders

Description: On January 5, 2007, the Tennessee Regulatory Authority (TRA) issued orders in dockets 06-00182 and 06-00183 stating that Entergy and Kentucky Utilities had already implemented standards 11 (net metering), 14 (time-based metering), and 15 (interconnection) as described by PURPA 2005, prior to August 8, 2005 and further consideration of those standards by TRA was not required (i.e., declining to make any changes in the existing standards).

In August 2007, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) adopted a modified version of PURPA 2005: ""TVA shall make available, upon request, interconnection service, for generators with output of 20 MW or less, to any electric consumer that it serves."" As part of its decision, TVA is allowing the distribution utilities that operate in its territory the flexibility to create their own interconnection procedures that are similar to TVA's.

TVA also offers the Dispersed Power Production Program, under which a facility that generates small amounts of power (typically less than 80 MW), including CHP systems, may qualify to connect to TVA power lines. Once connected, a qualifying facility can either use its power for itself and sell any extra to TVA at TVA's avoided costs, or it can sell all of its power to TVA at TVA's avoided costs.

","There are currently no state policies designed to acquire energy savings from CHP (like other efficiency resources) or energy generation from CHP (in terms of kWh production) that apply to all forms of CHP.

Last Updated: July 2018
","Tennessee has several policies and programs in place that can incentivize CHP deployment in addition to other technologies and resources.

In 2015, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) issued a request for proposals to industrial customers in the TVA-service area to provide technical guidance and financial assistance towards the capital costs of waste heat recovery and/or CHP projects. The objective is to provide up to $7 Million to establish at least 5 MW of customer-owned generation from waste heat recovery and CHP. TVA awarded $6.75 Million to Erlanger Health Systems in Chattanooga, TN to build a 6 MW CHP facility, which is under construction. 

In 2016, TVA announced it was awarding $6.75 million toward Erlanger Health System's new 8MW onsite CHP facility in Chattanooga, TN. The system became operational in late 2018 and is providing electricity, steam, and chilled water to the hospital campus. TVA and The Chemours Company also announced in January 2015 that they would convert a limited-use combustion turbine at TVA Johnsonville into a highly efficient CHP plant while continuing to provide steam to Chemours, which came online in 2018 with a capacity of 87 MW.

The Pathway Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Loan Program (EELP), a low-interest revolving loan fund, launched in 2010 to assist Tennessee for-profit and not-for-profit commercial and industrial businesses in implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements. In January 2016, EELP was expanded to offer financing to local government entities, including municipalities, counties, school districts, and other public agencies. Pathway Lending, a US Treasury certified community development financial institution, oversees the $33 million revolving loan fund, which is comprised of loan capital provided by the State / the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s Office of Energy Programs (TDEC OEP) ($14 million), the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) ($14 million), and Pathway Lending ($5 million). Eligible projects under EELP include, but are not limited to: energy efficient equipment upgrades; lighting; building envelope retrofits; cool roofs; renewable energy installations; and co-generation, including CHP.

Throughout 2018, five-year term Energy Efficiency loans had a fixed interest rate of 2%, and ten-year term Renewable Energy loans had a fixed interest rate of 5%. Local government entities were eligible to receive up to six years of financing at a 2% interest for qualified energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Qualifying entities could apply for loans between $20,000 and $5 million.

At the State level, the Tennessee General Assembly passed the Energy Independence Act  in 2014, which amended TCA §67-4-2004(9) to include facilities utilizing natural gas in a CHP configuration, granting them the same treatment as geothermal, hydrogen, solar, and wind sources for excise tax assessment purposes, based on the cost of installation. 

Further, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission, through TCA §65-5-103, may authorize utilities to recover operational expenses and capital costs and earn a return on CHP installations in industrial and commercial sites. This 2014 statutory change opened up opportunities for investment, innovation, and partnerships with investor owned utilities in the State of Tennessee.

 

Last Updated: July 2019
","Some additional supportive policies exist to encourage CHP in Tennessee. The Qualified Energy Conservation Bond Program and Clean Tennessee Energy Grant Program have both been used in the past to encourage the deployment of waste heat to power (WHP) systems in the state.

The University of Tennessee Center for Industrial Services also helps companies evaluate, measure, and create a site-specific energy plan, which may include evaluating CHP options. 

In February 2019, the Board of Directors for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the federally-owned corporate electricity provider for Tennessee, approved a project that will seek to deploy CHP, solar, and other technologies to address behind-the-meter customer needs. This project, called the DER Flexibility Research Project, allows member utilities to deploy CHP systems as well as to enter into a purchased power agreement with TVA for the power provided. The project is capped at 300MW total, of which a third may be CHP. TVA and the member utility organization have stated goals for the project of providing high levels of distribution system reliability and resiliency.

Major facilities are defined as construction projects larger than 20,000 gross square feet of occupied or conditioned space. For new construction, the criteria specify that public buildings must be certified to be at least 10% more efficient than ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2007, as it existed on January 1, 2009. The law directed the Arkansas Energy Office to develop a program to manage energy, water, and other public agency utility uses to reduce total energy consumption as long as the savings can be justified by a life cycle cost analysis. The Arkansas Energy Office must update this program annually. HB 1663 also directed the Arkansas Energy Office to complete an energy audit of every public agency within five years.

In May 2009, Governor Mike Beebe issued Executive Order 09-07, directing all executive-branch agencies to submit strategic energy plans describing energy-savings measures that can be implemented by the agencies. The plans should include provisions for collecting and monitoring energy use data. Other state agencies are encouraged to develop strategic energy plans as well.

Arkansas Act 1494 of 2009 requires all state agencies paying utility bills required to submit usage reports through Energy Star Portfolio Manager. Other agencies and institutions of higher learning encouraged to do so on a voluntary basis. The state currently benchmarks over 25 million square feet of public building space.

",7 out of 20,"Utility-sector energy efficiency initiatives in Arkansas have increased significantly since 2007, when the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) approved Rules for Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs requiring electric and gas utilities to propose and administer energy efficiency programs. In 2010, the APSC further established the importance of energy efficiency as a resource by adopting an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) for both electricity and natural gas, guidelines for efficiency program cost recovery and a shareholder performance incentive, and new guidelines for utility resource planning, which include provisions for demand-side resources. 

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

","In May 2007, the Public Service Commission approved Rules for Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs requiring electric and gas utilities to propose and administer energy efficiency programs (Docket No. 06-004-R, Orders No. 1, 12, 18). The state’s jurisdictional utilities filed energy efficiency plans in July 2007, containing proposed quick-start efficiency programs. All seven gas and electric utilities elected to sponsor and fund statewide programs supporting weatherization and energy efficiency education. The three gas companies jointly sponsored a statewide energy audit program for commercial and industrial customers. Each of the seven utilities individually proposed EE programs. There are 22 electric utilities regulated by the APSC, including cooperatives and investor-owned utilities, but not municipal or independent power producers.

In 2010, the APSC further established the importance of energy efficiency as a resource by adopting an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), guidelines for efficiency program cost recovery and a shareholder performance incentive, and new guidelines for utility resource planning, which include provisions for demand-side resources. Since then, electric and gas utilities have significantly expanded their energy efficiency program portfolios in order to meet the annual energy efficiency targets. Recovery of direct program costs associated with commission-approved energy efficiency programs is accomplished through an energy efficiency cost recovery rider on customer bills.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.

Utilities are required to consider ""all reasonably useful and economic supply and demand resources that are available to a utility or its customers"" for ""incremental capacity needs."" Further, ""utility efforts to encourage energy efficiency, conservation, demand-side management, interruptible load and price responsive demand should be identified.""

Although there is no loading order prioritizing energy efficiency, the Commission approved Rules for Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs in May 2007 (Docket 06-004-R), and subsequently established an EERS in 2010, requiring utilities to file energy efficiency plans to implement cost-effective energy efficiency programs.

","Summary: For 2020-2022, savings targets are 1.20% of 2018 baseline sales for electric utilities, and 0.5% of baseline sales for natural gas utilities. Incremental savings targets were 0.9% annually for 2015-2018, and 1.0% for 2019, with yearly incremental natural gas savings of 0.5% for 2017-2019. 

In 2018 the PSC ordered higher incremental savings targets in Docket No. 13-002-U, Order No. 43. For program years 2020-2022, the utilities are now required to hit savings targets 1.20% of 2018 baseline sales for electric utilities and 0.50% of 20l8 baseline sales for natural gas utilities. 

In December 2010, Arkansas PSC adopted an energy efficiency resource standard (see Docket No. 08-144-U). The targets set by the Public Service Commission were moderate, rising from a yearly reduction of 0.25% of total electric kilowatt hour (kWh) sales in 2011, to 0.5% in 2012, and 0.75% in 2013. Natural gas targets were set at 0.2% in 2011, 0.3% in 2012, and 0.4% in 2013.

In January 2013, the Public Service Commission issued an order in Docket 13-002-U seeking comment on proposed savings goals for the next three-year program cycle. The proposed goals by the PSC staff would double the previous yearly electricity savings levels to 1% of sales in the first program year, 1.25% in the second, and 1.5% in the third.  Proposed savings targets for natural gas would more than double the previous targets: 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1% per year. Based on stakeholder feedback, the PSC rescheduled the filing date to June 1, 2014, for the next three-year program cycle, and pushed back the start year so that the new program cycle is 2015-2017. For 2014, the PSC directed program administrators to use the energy savings targets, budgets, and the incentive structure previously approved for Program Year 2013 (unless program administrators seek to make modifications to program plans for approval by the PSC). In September 2013, the PSC issued an order setting an electricity savings target of 0.9% and a natural gas savings target of 0.6% for 2015. These targets were extended through 2016.

In December 2015, the PSC issued an order extending the 0.9% electricity savings target through 2018, ramping up to 1.0% in 2019, with a natural gas savings target of 0.5% for 2017-2019.

","Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test, participant cost test, ratepayer impact measure test
The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Arkansas relies on regulatory orders (APSC Rules for Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs, Docket 06-004-R). The Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) administers evaluations. The Commission requires each utility to hire an independent EM&V contractor and to fund jointly an independent EM&V monitor, but there are no specific legal requirements for these evaluations in Arkansas.  The Commission requires all EM&V activities to be consistent with the Arkansas Technical Reference Manual (TRM), as stated in the efficiency rules.

Arkansas uses four of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC), Utility/Programs Administrator (UCT), Participant (PCT), and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM). The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in APSC Rules for Conservation and Energy Efficiency Programs, Docket 06-004-R. Arkansas specifies the TRC to be its primary cost-effectiveness test. According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Arkansas applies the TRC primarily at the program level and secondarily at the portfolio and measure level. Arkansas’ TRC accounts for non-energy costs and benefits associated with water savings, other fuels, participants’ equipment replacement costs, participant measure costs, and additional non-energy benefits (NEBs) for low-income customers.

Arkansas recently conducted a review of their current practices to assess its alignment with principles of the National Standard Practice Manual (NSPM).

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Arkansas is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

There are no specific spending or savings requirements for low-income energy efficiency programs.

Following unsuccessful attempts in the early 2000s to create a low-income weatherization program, the Arkansas Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the Arkansas Weatherization Program (AWP) in 2007 in Order No. 4 in Docket No. 07-079-TF, as a quick start program. In February 2010, the PSC approved AWP to run through June 2011, and subsequent orders have extended AWP through 2018. In 2014, in response to a proposal to develop a consistent approach for weatherization programs across all Arkansas utilities, the PSC approved a uniform weatherization program in PSC Docket 13-002-U, Order No. 22 at 11.

Act 1102 of 2017 (Ark. Code Ann. Sec. 23-2-304(a)(11)) was passed by the Arkansas General Assembly, authorizing the Commission to ""propose develop, solicit, approve, require, implement and monitor financial assistance programs"" for utility customers who are 65 years of age or older or who meet the income eligibility qualifications of LIHEAP.  After notice and a hearing, the Commission may approve and order a financial assistance program for utility customers if the Commission determines that the program is beneficial to the ratepayers of a public utility and the public utility. That authorization is contingent on the provision that the Commission shall not fix rates, charges, or surcharges that recover, directly or indirectly, any portion of the cost of programs authorized by this Act from a ratepayer that is not in the customer class of ratepayers eligible to participate in the programs. The Commission has not taken action to implement this authority by either order or rule.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Arkansas does not require program-level cost-effectiveness for low-income programs.

Coordination of Ratepayer-Funded Low-Income Programs with WAP Services

AWP funds from utilities are administered in conjunction with US DOE WAP funds. The provider installs the approved measures in the home. Part of the cost of the audit and installation is covered by the customer’s AWP utility, and the balance is paid by the customer. Customers eligible for the DOE WAP have their co-payment covered by that federal program.

","In December 2010, the Arkansas PSC approved a joint electric and gas utility motion to allow the awarding of lost contributions to fixed costs that result from future utility energy efficiency programs. All investor-owned utilities were approved to recover lost revenues as part of the annual energy efficiency program tariff docket (See Order No. 14 Docket 08-137-U).

In 2007 rate cases, the Arkansas PSC approved a decoupling mechanism, a billing determinant adjustment (BDA) tariff that furthers its goal of promoting energy efficiency, for the three major natural gas distribution companies in the state. The purpose of the BDA tariff is to account for declines in non-gas revenues due to declining gas volumes caused by conservation and decreasing billing determinants. The tariff applies to the Residential and Small Commercial rate classes and was in effect for three evaluation periods (2008, 2009, and 2010). (See Docket No. 07-016-U for Arkansas Oklahoma Gas).

In December 2010 the PSC issued an order approving a general policy under which the Commission outlined steps to approve incentives to reward achievement in the delivery of essential energy conservation services by investor-owned utilities. (See Order No. 15 Docket 08-137-U). Incentives were approved for all three gas utilities in the state and the two largest electric utilities in 2012 and 2013.

Energy efficiency performance incentives are awarded annually for achievement ranging between 80% and 120% of the Commission-established performance goal. The performance incentive is 10% of portfolio total resource cost net benefits, limited to a percentage of program budgets ranging from 4% of program budgets to 8% of program budgets, based linearly on the degree of achievement.

New construction and renovation of existing buildings between 5,000 and 15,000 square feet must achieve a minimum delivered energy performance standard of 50% of the average consumption for that building type. Renovations of existing buildings in excess of 15,000 square feet and/or using over 50 kW peak electric demand must meet LEED-Silver standards and achieve a minimum delivered energy performance standard of 50% of the U.S. energy consumption for that building type. Under Executive Order 2006-01 and Senate Bill 200 (below), the state reviews over $186 million of renovation projects in all institutions of higher learning that must meet these criteria.

New Mexico continues to implement Executive Order 2007-053, which launched a statewide energy efficiency initiative that calls for state agencies to reduce energy usage by 20% below 2005 levels by 2015.  The 2012 DOE SEP competitive award has a goal to realize 20% energy savings by the year 2020 in the General Services Department building inventory through the WISE (Whole-building Investments for Sustainable Efficiency) program.

SB 200 of 2010 established a wider building requirement for certain building projects throughout the state that receive state funding. New buildings and building additions of 3,000 square feet or more, and buildings undergoing certain system renovations must be designed and constructed to attain Energy Star certification. These buildings must meet an Energy Star rating of 75 or better. The Energy Conservation and Management Division (EMCD) encourages public entities to conduct energy audits then provides technical assistance to enable these entities to implement and fund identified measures. In addition, ECMD state tracks energy use in public buildings using Portfolio Manager. This data will be used to develop and inform a sustainable whole building energy retrofit program for public facilities. To date, the state has benchmarked approximately 20% of public buildings.

The state of New Mexico and the staff of the Energy Conservation and Management Division (ECMD) and State Energy Office (SEO) are committed in meeting the EPACT Goal of improving energy efficiency by 25%, the Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI) and the 20in20 initiative. Many steps have been taken to promote energy efficiency in New Mexico, including the implementation of many clean energy Executive Orders. The State Energy Office will also be reviewing and evaluating New Mexico's energy usage data to measure compliance with these goals. This will be reported by the end of each program year.

Biomass-fueled CHP systems are eligible for a corporate tax credit through the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit and a sales tax incentive through the Biomass Equipment & Materials Compensating Tax Deduction. Additionally, the Energy Transition Act includes a 100 percent Zero Carbon Resource Standard. A Zero Carbon Resource, as defined by the Act, means an electricity generation resource that emits no carbon dioxide into theatmosphere, or that reduces methane emitted into the atmosphere in an amount equal to no less than one-tenth of the tons of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, as a result of electricity production. This definition, is a direct carve-out for anaerobic digesters which often use the digester gas for heat and power production and may included co-firing with fossil fuels. The one-tenth ratio allows for up to 72% of co-firing natural gas with captured digester gas to still be considered a ""zero carbon resource"". Recycled energy projects may also be eligible for an Advanced Energy Tax Credit. The state energy office also partners with USDOE support services to address any needs from any entity that requests assistance.

New Mexico has used the DOE CHP Technical Assistance Partnership program on several occasions in the past 3 years. Currently, the state energy office is working with the Houston Advanced Research Center to organize two workshops targeted to the state's large oil and gas industry. The workshops will focus on combined heat and power and will also highlight pending regulations targeting waste in the sector including venting and flaring of associated gas and produced water recycling and reuse.

",5.5 out of 20,"New Mexico has three investor-owned electric utilities (IOUs), three natural gas utilities, and seventeen customer-owned rural electric distribution cooperatives. The 2005 Efficient Use of Energy Act requires the electric IOUs and gas utilities to acquire cost-effective and achievable energy efficiency (EE) and load management resources available in their territories (NMSA 1978, §62-17-5(G)). Electric IOUs must spend 3% of customer bills, while the gas utilities shall not spend more than 3% of total annual revenues. Currently, the three electric IOUs and the largest gas utility, New Mexico Gas, choose to recover program costs and a proposed profit incentive through a tariff rider with an annual reconciliation mechanism. These four utilities offer a variety of energy efficiency programs, including programs targeted at low-income customers and multi-family housing.

Electric IOUs have a statutory goal of saving 8% of 2005 retails sales through their EE programs by calendar year 2020, which was updated by HB 291 in 2019 to call for 5% savings relative to 2020 retail sales between 2021-2025. The three electric IOUs, Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS), and El Paso Electric (EPE), are all on target to meet current savings goal.

The rural electric distribution cooperatives are only required to examine the potential for offering cost-effective programs to reduce energy consumption or peak electricity demand (NMSA 1978, §62-17-11(A)). Each cooperative's governing body will approve any slate of programs. A percentage of the cooperatives offers energy efficiency programs as of 2019.

","The Efficient Use of Energy Act (EUEA), enacted in 2005, directs New Mexico's public utilities to evaluate and implement cost-effective energy efficiency and load management programs in their resource portfolios (NMSA 1978, Chapter 62 Article 17). Electric and natural gas utilities shall achieve savings of 5% of 2005 total retail kWh sales by 2014 and 8% of 2005 total retail kWh sales by 2020. This was later updated in 2019 by HB 291 to call for 5% savings relative to 2020 retail sales between 2021-2025.

Program costs are 3% of customer bills for investor-owned electric utilities and shall not exceed 3% of total annual revenues for gas utilities. Program costs and incentives may be recovered through a tariff rider or base rates. Distribution cooperative utilities are to establish targets for energy efficiency and load management and implement those programs that are economically feasible and practical for their members and customers. Cooperative members shall approve any such programs (NMSA 1978, §62-17-11).

The NM Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) updated its rule implementing the EUEA in October 2014 (Case No. 13-00310-UT). Beginning in 2015, each public electric and natural gas utility must file an annual application and report (17.7.2 NMAC). Public Service Company of New Mexico shall file on March 1. Southwestern Public Service Company shall file on May 1. El Paso Electric Company shall file on July 1. Natural gas utilities shall file on January 1. Distribution cooperatives shall file an annual report on May 1.

The New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (PRC) sets out the rules for implementing statute. The PRC's energy efficiency rule, NMAC 17.7.2, was updated in 2014 (Case No. 13-00310-UT).

The PRC mandates that electric utilities must file an IRP and a four-year action plan every three years. The Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) rule states that ""the utility shall consider all feasible supply-side and demand-side resources"" when identifying possible resource options (NMAC 17.7.3.9.F).

","Summary: 5% reduction from 2005 total retail electricity sales by 2014, and an 8% reduction by 2020. HB 291 calls for a further 5% reduction from 2020 total retail electricity sales for programs implemented from years 2021 to 2025

In 2008, New Mexico legislature passed HB 305, which amended the Efficient Use of Energy Act (first passed in 2005) and established energy efficiency targets for the state. The 2008 law required investor-owned utilities to achieve a 5% reduction from 2005 total retail electricity sales by 2014 and a 10% reduction by 2020 (see NM Stat. § 62-17-1 et seq.).

The state’s targets were amended in 2013 with the passage of HB 267. The law established a fixed tariff rider for funding energy efficiency and load management programs. The bill was a compromise among energy efficiency advocates, New Mexico’s utilities, and representatives of the Public Regulation Commission, and preserved the targets but reduced the energy savings requirement in 2020 for electric utilities from 10% to 8% of sales.

In early 2019, the New Mexico legislature passed HB 291, requires efficiency programs by public utilities to achieve savings no less than 5% of 2020 total retail kWh sales from programs implemented in years 2021 through 2025. Also, no later than June 30, 2025, the commission shall adopt, through HB 291 rulemaking, energy savings targets for electric utilities for years 2026 through 2030 based on cost-effective and achievable energy savings and provide utility incentives based on savings achieved.

Distribution cooperative utilities, which are not fully regulated by the PRC, must annually consider self-imposed electricity reduction targets and design demand-side management programs to enable them to meet those targets. Each cooperative utility must submit a report to the PRC annually describing their demand-side management efforts from the previous year.

Section 8 of the Efficient Use of Energy Act concerns the legislative requirements for measurement and verification of energy efficiency programs. Annual reports must be submitted by each utility and a comprehensive M&V report must be conducted by an independent evaluator every three years. Typically, a subset of programs is independently evaluated every year. New programs are independently evaluated in their first year, and every year the two programs with the highest projected energy savings are evaluated. The Commission has oversight in selecting the independent program evaluator and uses an RFP process for this purpose.  



According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), New Mexico uses the Utility Cost Test (UCT) as the primary test for decision making and evaluating program cost-effectiveness. The benefit-cost tests are required for total program level screening.

","Requirements for State and Utility Support of Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The state’s energy efficiency targets, first established in 2005 within the Efficient Use of Energy Act, were amended in 2013 with the passage of HB 267. The legislation calls for an 8% reduction of energy consumption as a percent of sales by 2020 and also directs that no less than 5% of the amount received by the public utility for program costs shall be specifically directed to energy efficiency programs for low-income customers.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

The utility cost test (UCT) is conducted in New Mexico and is considered to be the primary test for decision making and evaluating program cost effectiveness. HB 267 directs that “…In developing this test for energy efficiency and load management programs directed to low-income customers, the commission shall either quantify or assign a reasonable value to reductions in working capital, reduced collection costs, lower bad-debt expense, improved customer service effectiveness and other appropriate factors as utility system economic benefits.”

It was later codified in New Mexico Administrative Code that “in developing the utility cost test for energy efficiency and load management measures and programs directed to low-income customers, unless otherwise quantified in a commission proceeding, the public utility shall assume that 20% of the calculated energy savings is the reasonable value of reductions in working capital, reduced collection costs, lower bad-debt expense, improved customer service, effectiveness, and other appropriate factors qualifying as utility system economic benefits” [17.7.2.9 NMAC - Rp. 17.7.2.9 NMAC, 1-1-15].

","A self-direct option is offered statewide in the territories of three investor-owned utilities. Eligible customers must have electricity consumption greater than 7,000 MWh per year. Participants can receive credit for up to 70% of the annual energy efficiency rider. Self-direct customers provide their own engineering analysis and must meet the same total resource cost test as all the other industrial and commercial offerings. The customer must demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility that its expenditures are cost-effective. Eligible expenditures must have a simple payback period of more than one year but less than seven years.

There is no provision for large customers to opt out entirely from paying for energy efficiency programs.

","Currently no utility has a decoupling or lost revenue adjustment mechanism in New Mexico, however HB 291 (2019) specifically allows for adoption of a decoupling mechanism that ensures that the revenue per customer approved by the commission in a general rate case proceeding is recovered by the public utility without regard to the quantity of electricity actually sold by the public utility.

The Efficient Use of Energy Act and the Rule do allow a utility to propose a profit incentive mechanism that is based on satisfactory program performance and does not exceed the product of the approved annual program costs and its weighted average cost of capital. PNM, EPE, and SPS all earn an incentive award. NM Gas proposed an incentive award in its Plan Year 2017 program for the first time.

El Paso Electric's 2016 profit incentive was decided in a stipulated agreement in Case No. 13-00176-UT and was set at 7% of a 2016 budget of approximately $5.8 million. Southwestern Public Service's 2016 profit incentive was decided in Case No. 15-00119-U. It earns a base level incentive of 6.8% on a budget of approximately $11.5 million, based on a minimum cumulative savings threshold. This amount can be adjusted downward if there is a shortfall in low income program spending in program year 2016. Each GWh of additional savings above 31.805 net customer GWh earns an additional 0.1% in profit incentive, up to a maximum of 7.11%. Finally, Public Service Company of New Mexico's 2016 profit incentive was also decided in a stipulated agreement in Case No. 14-00310-UT and is based on a linear progression of cumulative savings towards the 2020 goal. The 2016 profit incentive is conditional on achieving energy savings of 6% of 2005 retail sales and is approximately 7.1% of program costs.

In 2008, the state passed a law that established an EERS with energy savings goals for electric utilities and allows for cost recovery and decoupling. Rules for implementing the law were published by the PUCO in July 2009. The rules require utilities to propose energy efficiency plans and file annual status reports with the commission. However, these rules were pulled back by the state legislature in 2014. Despite this, most utilities in the state will likely still offer some level of efficiency programs.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables.
","With passage of SB 221 in 2008, Ohio established the foundation for the full range of customer energy efficiency programs now available.

This legislation also explicitly included demand-response programs and transmission and distribution system improvements. Though the statute was pulled back in 2014, many utilities indicate they will continue to offer similar levels of efficiency programming.

Ohio’s regulated distribution utilities administer their own energy efficiency programs with oversight from PUCO. PUCO may also modify the utilities' proposed programs. Ohio natural gas utilities also run efficiency programs.

Financing options also are available to customers. The Advanced Energy Fund, instituted in 1999, supports an Energy Efficiency Revolving Loan Fund that is administered by the state. A universal service rider, a type of surcharge, supports the Ohio Energy Loan Fund, providing low income bill assistance and efficiency incentives.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Ohio relies on regulatory orders (Green Rules as adopted by the Commission in Case No. 08-888-EL-ORD). Evaluations are administered by both the utilities and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Rules and requirements for these evaluations are drafted in the Draft Technical Reference Manual Docket: Case No. 09-512-GE-UNC. Evaluations are conducted statewide and for each of the utilities. Ohio uses two of the five classic benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC) and Utility/Program Administrator (UCT) tests, with the TRC used as the primary test according to the Ohio administrative code (4091:1-39-01 (Y). The benefit-cost tests are required for portfolio and customer project level screening and are stated in Case No. 09-512-GE-UNC.

Ohio’s TRC accounts for productivity as a participant non-energy benefit. Additionally, Ohio includes water and fossil fuel savings. While it is expected that most programs pass the TRC, Ohio utilities can run programs that do not pass the TRC if they demonstrate high non-energy benefits. These non-energy benefits include participant asset value, economic well-being, comfort, health and safety, and satisfaction as well as environmental impacts, public health, economic development and jobs, and energy. While low-income programs do not have to pass the TRC, Ohio mandates a low-income specific program.

Ohio’s Restructuring Act, passed in July 1999, created the Universal Service Fund to control the cost of state’s Percentage of Income Payment Plan (PIPP) for low-income customers. Sec. 4928.55 of the legislation also directed the creation of the Electric Partnership Program (EPP) to target high-cost, high-volume PIPP or PIPP-eligible households. The EPP is designed to improve the electric efficiency of low-income households who participate in or are eligible for PIPP Plus. The program performs in-home audits and installs appropriate electric energy efficiency measures. About $15 million is set aside for the EPP each year. In addition to the EPP, most of Ohio’s gas utilities have weatherization programs, typically coordinated with the federal Weatherization Assistance Program.

Cost-Effectiveness Rules for Low-Income Energy Efficiency Programs

Ohio uses the total resource cost (TRC) test and the utility cost test (UCT). Ohio specifies the TRC as its primary test for decision making. The benefit-cost tests are required for portfolio and customer project-level screening and are stated in Case No. 09-512-GE-UNC.

","Self-direct options are available for large customers in Ohio. Under SB 221, a mercantile customer, which is a commercial or industrial customer that consumes more than 700,000 kWh per year, may enter into a special arrangement with an electric utility to integrate the customer’s demand reduction, demand-response, or energy efficiency programs with those of the electric utility. If the specified reduction levels are met, the customer can request exemption from the cost recovery mechanism.

One of the state’s utilities, AEP, has a self-direct program that offers customers an incentive for previously implemented energy efficiency measures. The one-time incentive is 75% of what the measure would cost under AEP programs and has a maximum limit of $225,000. Projects must have been implemented after Jan. 1, 2008, and must produce 100% of stated energy savings and/or peak demand reductions over a five-year period. Customers taking the incentive are still eligible to participate in the utility's other energy efficiency programs because they are still paying the cost-recovery mechanism (CRM) fee.

Dayton Power & Light had their electric security plan approved by PUCO, which extends their existing generation rate plan through Dec. 31, 2012. Duke operates the Save-A-Watt program through which it recovers lost revenues (Docket 08-920-EL-SSO).

In November 2011, both Duke Ohio and AEP Ohio agreed provisionally to forgo collection of lost revenues and develop a decoupling mechanism for total rate recovery for residential and small commercial customers. PUCO must approve and finalize the agreements. AEP: Docket 11-0351-EL-AIR; Duke: Docket 11-3549-EL-SSO.

In the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio’s (PUCO) rules, the commission may provide for decoupling, and an electric distribution utility may submit an application for approval of a revenue decoupling mechanism to PUCO. Rather than true decoupling, the gas utilities have all been allowed to implement straight-fixed-variable rate designs. Rule: ORC §4928.143(B)(2)(h); Duke riders: Docket Nos. 06-0091-EL-UNC, 06-0092-EL-UNC, and 06-0093-GA-UNC.

Incentives may be approved on a case-by-case basis. First Energy and AEP have had performance incentives approved. The recovery mechanism is an annually reconciled rider, which includes conditioned adjustments for shared savings with a maximum 10% shareholder incentive if at least 65% of targeted savings are achieved. Duke Energy has a program called Save-A-Watt, which limits the incentive to 15% of program costs (Docket 08-920-EL-SSO). Columbia Gas also filed for a shared savings mechanism in September 2011, which was subsequently approved in December 2011(Docket 11-5028-GA-UNC).

Beginning in January 2015, Ohio Senate Bill 310 gives certain customers the ability to opt-out of energy efficiency programs entirely. Large customers may opt out of a utility’s energy efficiency provisions if they meet one of the following criteria:

","In April 2009, the legislature passed S.B. 49, creating energy efficiency standards for state-owned and state-leased buildings. Energy efficiency building standards apply to new construction and major renovation projects for state-owned buildings and new construction projects for state-leased buildings. The buildings must exceed the effective most recent International Energy Conservation Code adopted by the state by 20%, to the extent that it is cost effective over the life of the building or renovation. Also, the current administration has launched a “Smart State Buildings” initiative to continue efforts of saving energy in State Buildings. Rather than targeting a specific reduction, building baselines will be determined and then targeted measures for each building will be implemented.

The State Building Energy Conservation Program (SBECP) uses an internal database to perform energy saving verification studies at buildings receiving facility upgrades for projects designed to save energy. 100% of eligible buildings with square footage greater than 20,000 sq ft have been benchmarked; information is available on the DEQ Energy Office website. The SBECP also provides a free portal energy tracking services to local government and K-12 schools. Under the Governor’s Smart State Building Initiative; state building energy usage is available for public viewing. To date, the state has benchmarked approximately 15% of state buildings.

In April 2014, Governor Steve Bullock directed state agencies to begin monitoring energy use in state buildings and to begin publicly disclosing these energy numbers online. This directive by the Governor is part of a larger commitment to smart energy use and consumption, the promotion of energy efficiency and conservation in Montana, as well as a more transparent state government.

Primary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: total resource cost test
	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test,  societal cost test, ratepayer impact measure test



The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Montana relies on regulatory orders (Utility Division Docket No. D2003.6.77, Order No. 6496f and Utility Division Docket No. D2004.6.90, Order No. 6574e.). Evaluations are mainly administered by the utilities. There are no specific legal requirements for these evaluations in Montana, and the rules for benefit-cost tests are not specified. Evaluations are conducted for each of the utilities.

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Montana uses a Total Resource Cost model (TRC) as its primary cost effectiveness test for decision making. In addition, Montana uses the Utility Cost Test (UCT), Societal Cost Test (SCT) and Ratepayer Impact Measure test (RIM) as secondary tests. The benefit-cost tests are required for the individual measure level for program screening, but there are exceptions for low-income programs, pilots, and new technologies.

Though not included in the primary total resource cost test, a 10% environmental adder incorporated into the societal cost test is intended to account for the non-energy benefits of EE. The adder functions as an upward adjustment to utility avoided costs. The adder approach is generally considered easy to apply and an effective way to account for external environmental benefits.

The evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Oklahoma relies on regulatory orders and Commission rules (Title 165 CC Chapter 35 Electric Utility Rules Subchapter 41; Demand Programs 165:35-41-7). The administering utilities are primarily responsible for timely evaluation, measurement, and verification of their energy efficiency programs. Oklahoma uses all of the five benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual to evaluate energy efficiency programming. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC), Utility/Program Administrator (UCT), Participant (PCT), Social Cost (SCT), and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM). The benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio, total program, customer project, and individual measure level screening. The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Title 165 CC Chapter 35 Electric Utility Rules. Gas utilities are subject to the same rules (See OAC k165:45-23-7).

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Oklahoma specifies the TRC as its primary test for decision making. Oklahoma’s TRC accounts for the non-energy impact of net participant measure costs. Oklahoma’s low-income program, the weatherization residential assistance program (WRAP), may have a lower threshold for TRC test results. Additionally, non-resource benefits can be included in the TRC, but they are not in practice.

This executive order created the Governor's Energy Challenge 2020 as part of ""Conserve Georgia."" State agencies and departments must reduce energy consumption 15% by 2020, using 2007 energy use as a baseline. Reductions in energy use must come from energy efficiency measures and can also come from renewable energy development. State agencies regularly track their own energy consumption at the account level and report that energy consumption annually to GEFA. 

Also in 2008, Senate Bill 130  called for building commissioning for new state buildings and requires new state buildings to exceed ASHRAE 90.1.2004 energy efficiency standards by 30%. This act also requires state buildings over 10,000 square feet to be designed, constructed, and commissioned or modeled to achieve a 15 percent reduction in water use when compared to water use based on plumbing fixture selection in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

",3.5 out of 20,"From 2007 to 2014, Indiana had been expanding customer energy efficiency programs. Both electric and natural gas utilities administered programs for their customers as a result of regulatory orders and other decisions by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Through 2013, the electric utilities offered a portfolio of core programs, organized and coordinated as Energizing Indiana, as a statewide, common platform. However, in 2014, the state legislature voted to disband Energizing Indiana programs. Prior to the rollback of the state's energy efficiency resource standard (EERS), growth of these programs had been steady, although overall spending on programs was still modest in comparison to leading Midwestern states.

SEA 412 (Senate Enrolled Act 412), signed into law by Governor Pence in 2015, requires utilities to seek approval of new energy efficiency plans at least once every three years and requires EM&V procedures to be included in an electricity supplier's energy efficiency plan.

The most recent budgets for energy efficiency programs and electricity and natural gas savings can be found in the State Spending and Savings Tables on the left.

","Both natural gas and electric utilities in Indiana operate energy efficiency programs. These utilities include Duke Energy Indiana, Indiana Michigan Power Company (I&M), Indianapolis Power and Light (IPL), NIPSCO, and Vectren. While some of these utilities have had programs for over a decade, they have historically been relatively small.

In 2007, the state’s regulators, utilities, and stakeholders began efforts to expand customer energy efficiency programs and to establish targets for energy savings through such programs. This has led to a series of dockets at the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC). A commission order (in Cause 42693) called on all electric utilities to provide a core set of statewide programs. It was implemented starting January 2, 2012. The order in Phase II of the investigation (Cause 42693 S1) required regulated utilities to achieve escalating energy savings targets. The investor-owned utilities contracted with a single, independent, third-party administrator to jointly administer and implement a core set of programs, which was called Energizing Indiana. Non-jurisdictional utilities, such as cooperatives and municipal utilities, were invited to participate in the statewide core program. However, most of these non-jurisdictional utilities chose not to participate.

Energizing Indiana, which was created as the result of IURC orders on customer energy efficiency programs, provided a statewide approach offered by all regulated electric utilities. Utilities also implemented additional programs outside of the shared Energizing Indiana programs, which were called Core Plus programs.

SB 340 eliminated Energizing Indiana, as well as the specific targets set in the Phase II order. IOUs were required to file new plans. The bill includes an opt-out provision that allows customers that operate a single site with at least one meter constituting more than 1 MW demand for any one billing period within the previous 12 months to opt out of programs. Over 125 companies have provided notice to opt out. The 2015 energy efficiency plans approved for Duke, Vectren, IPL, I&M and NIPSCO continue many of their previous programs. 

Natural gas programs were not subject to the Phase II order in Cause 42693 S1 and were not part of Energizing Indiana. Combination electric-gas utilities did and continue to offer joint programs. The IURC requires natural gas utilities to complete market potential studies, annual operating plans, annual reports, and EM&V reports for their customer programs. NIPSCO and Vectren currently offer natural gas energy efficiency programs. Citizens Gas & Citizens Gas of Westfield suspended energy efficiency programs in 2016.

Under SEA 412, passed in 2015 and codified at Ind. Code § 8-1-8.5-10 (Section 10), Indiana utilities are required to submit energy efficiency plans for commission review no less often than once every three years. I&M’s current plan (Cause 44841) covers 2017-2019, Vectren (Cause 44927) and IPL (Cause 44945)  run from 2018-2020, while Duke (Cause 43955 DSM 3 S1) and NIPSCO (Cause 44634) have plan cycles that end in 2018 with new plans slated to run 2019-2021.

","Under current rules, electric utilities are required to submit resource plans every two years that cover a 20-year-planning horizon. Under requirements of the Indiana Administrative Code (170 IAC 4-7-1 through 4-7-9), the affected utilities are required “to consider alternative methods of meeting future demand for electric service.” The code adds that a utility “must consider a demand-side resource, including innovative rate design, as a source of new supply in meeting future electric service requirements.”

The rules are changing, however. The IURC reactivated a dormant rulemaking from 2011 to update the integrated resource planning and energy efficiency planning rules to align them with the legislative requirements that were updated in 2015’s SEA 412. SEA 412 requires utilities to submit an integrated resource plan to the IURC, requires IOUs to submit an energy efficiency plan to the IURC for approval at least one time every three years, and requires that EM&V procedures be included in an electricity supplier's energy efficiency plan. This EM&V administrator must be an independent or third party entity. Additionally, SEA 412 provides that the IURC may not require a third-party administrator to implement an electricity supplier's energy efficiency program or plan.

The updated rules (RM #15-06) are undergoing public hearings and are expected to be approved by the end of 2018. The 2018 resource plans are already operating under the general structure of the draft rule, which has been available in several draft forms since 2015. Among the changes that are underway for integrated resource planning in the updated rules are a requirement for plans every three years on a staggered schedule, requirements for stakeholder collaboration, and submission data requirements.

","Although the state has implemented savings targets in the past, no EERS is currently in place.

Indiana’s Commission ordered all jurisdictional electric utilities to begin submitting three-year DSM plans in July 2010, indicating their proposals and projected progress in meeting yearly savings goals outlined by the Commission. The goals began at 0.3% incremental savings in 2010, increasing to 1.1% in 2014, and leveling at 2% in 2019. Load management and direct load control initiatives, including peak-shaving, that result in net-energy savings was counted towards the goal. 

The decision also outlined a portfolio of core programs, called Energizing Indiana, offered by all affected utilities. The statewide approach offered consumers a uniform set of energy efficiency programs, using coordinated marketing, outreach, and consumer education strategies. The programs included: residential lighting, home energy audits, low-income weatherization, energy-efficient schools, and commercial and industrial. Energizing Indiana was administered by a single independent, third-party entity, which was contracted by all of the utilities. Utilities were able to oversee additional programs.

In March 2014, the Indiana legislature voted to end Energizing Indiana programs, effectively eliminating the state's EERS. Governor Pence neither signed nor vetoed the bill, and it became law in April 2014. Governor Pence voiced his support for energy efficiency, directing legislators and regulators to consider new frameworks for energy efficiency in the future. The 2015 legislative session of the Indiana General Assembly resulted in SEA 412 (Senate Enrolled Act 412), signed into law by the Governor. SEA 412 requires a public utility to submit an integrated resource plan to the IURC. After 2017, the utilities will be required to seek approval of new energy efficiency plans at least once every three years. Indiana allows utilities to recover the cost of these programs through rates, although certain industrial customers can opt out based on their electric usage. SEA 412 also requires that EM&V procedures be included in an electricity supplier's energy efficiency plan. Additionally, SEA 412 provides that the IURC may not require a third-party administrator to implement an electricity supplier's energy efficiency program or plan.

The IURC is in the process of a rulemaking to update and revise the commission's administrative rules for integrated resource planning and DSM cost recovery.

Indiana Administrative Code provides guidelines for demand-side recovery electric utilities, as well as lost-revenue recovery and demand-side management incentives.

	Secondary cost-effectiveness test(s) used: utility cost test, participant cost test, ratepayer impact measure test




Regulatory orders lay out the process for evaluation of ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in Indiana (Cause No. 42693, Phase II Order). Evaluations for electric programs are administered by both the utilities and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Requirements are in Section 4 of 170 IAC 4-8 Guidelines for Demand-Side Cost Recovery by Electric Utilities. Section 4 states: “Sec. 4. (a) When seeking commission approval for cost recovery, DSM incentives, or lost revenue, a utility shall develop a process and load impact evaluation plan to assess implementation and quantify the impact on energy and demand of the demand-side resource.”

According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Indiana specifies auses a Total Resource Cost test (TRC) to beas its primary cost effectiveness test for decision making. In addition, Indiana uses the Utility Cost Test (UCT), Ratepayer Impact Measure test (RIM) and Participant Cost Test (PCT) in aas secondary capacitytests. Indiana uses four of the five benefit-cost tests identified in the California Standard Practice Manual. These are the Total Resource Cost (TRC), Utility/Programs Administrator (UCT), Participant (PCT), and Ratepayer Impact Measure (RIM). The rules for benefit-cost tests are stated in Rule 8. 170 IAC 4-8. These benefit-cost tests are required for overall portfolio and program level screening. According to the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), Indiana relies on the TRC test as its primary cost-effectiveness test.

Effective December 31, 2014, SEA 340 ended the state-wide core program, vacated the Commission's DSM energy savings targets that were established in the 42693 DSM Phase II Order, and precluded the use of a statewide third-party administrator. With SEA 340, decisions relating to programs, goals, and evaluation are at discretion of the utility even though utility program oversight boards with non-utility stakeholders as members exist. IURC rules do require an independent vendor to conduct EM&V.

Natural gas programs are subject to EM&V developed by a third-party evaluator and directed by a Joint Oversight Board consisting of representatives from the utilities, the Indiana State Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, and the Citizens Action Coalition, a local non-profit representing the interests of Indiana consumers. Each natural gas utility that is authorized to recover costs associated with an energy efficiency program is required to perform EM&V annually and provide a report detailing the findings to the Commission as a compliance filing. Avoided natural gas production is included in Indianapolis Power and Light’s work-papers, but the value is always zero.

Further information on cost-effectiveness screening practices for Indiana is available in the Database of State Efficiency Screening Practices (DSESP), a resource of the National Efficiency Screening Project (NESP).

Utilities are now able to set their own, lower energy savings targets.... Beginning no later than calendar year 2017, utilities will be required to establish energy efficiency goals under Section 10. Section 10 authorizes a utility to recover reasonable financial incentives that encourage implementation of energy efficiency programs that are consistent with statutory resource planning requirements, or eliminate or offset regulatory or financial bias against either energy efficiency programs or in favor of supply-side resources. However, IPL has not submitted a plan under Section 10; therefore, it is not entitled to the reasonable financial incentives authorized by Section 10. Section 9(l) only states that, if the Commission determines the proposed energy efficiency programs are reasonable and cost effective, the electricity supplier may recover energy programs costs (which are defined by statute as program costs, lost revenues, and incentives approved by the Commission). In light of the reduced savings target, we see no reason to treat IPL's request differently from similar Section 9 proposals by Duke, I&M, and NIPSCO, in which the Commission denied requests for shared savings incentives. Accordingly, we do not approve any performance incentives for the 2017 plan year.""

SIGECO has made a filing under IC 8-1-8.5-10 that was accepted by the Commission in Cause No. 44645 and approved performance incentives to be tied to both tiered levels of energy savings achieved and the net present value of the net benefits of the UCT test.

The Energy Office has collected benchmarking data from public agencies, K-12 schools and colleges and universities for over a decade.  This data allows individual organizations to compare their energy use with others of a similar type, and adjust behavior accordingly.

In June 2008, the state enacted additional legislation, H.B. 4766, requiring state agencies and public school districts to reduce energy use by 20% by 2020, from 2000. Training sessions were conducted around the state to assist agencies in developing new or revised energy plans in support of that goal. In addition, the SC Energy Office developed a template that could be used by state agencies and local governments to develop their plans. Benchmarking data collection now also includes qualitative information regarding achievement of the goal, impediments, etc. The state continues to collect benchmarking data for public buildings under the 20% reduction mandate at SC Code SECTION 48-52-610 on an annual basis.  This section requires that state agencies submit their energy use data to the State Energy Office every year. State-leased buildings, as well as other facilities that petition the Energy Office, are excluded from these energy reduction and benchmarking requirements.

Achievement of the target will require successful development, regulatory approval, and implementation of energy efficiency programs.

Funding for demand-side management and energy efficiency programs is included in the utilities’ base rates. In April 2010, Senate Bill 1096 authorized electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities to implement financing systems for energy efficiency improvements.

South Carolina’s electric cooperatives offer customers some programs, including an on-bill financing program that allows members to reduce the upfront cost of energy efficiency investments. Leveraging the cooperatives’ existing relationships with members, the program utilizes funds from USDAs Rural Economic Loans and Grants Program (REDLG) to offer loans to customers, which are paid back on utility bills. The loans are tied to utility bills and the building’s meter, removing split incentives for homeowners who do not wish to stay in their home for the life of the loan.

","Gap Analysis/Strategic Compliance Plan: In 2011, Nebraska worked with BCAP to publish a gap analysis and strategic compliance plan.
	Baseline & Updated Compliance Studies: The Nebraska Energy Office finished data collection for its most recent residential compliance study on December 31, 2017. Data collection was in accordance with protocol established by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Building Energy Codes Program’s most recent field studies to document baseline practices. The residential data is currently being analyzed by Pacific Northwest National Labs. The Nebraska Energy Office is currently working with the DOE Building Energy Codes Program, under the direction of the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), to measure the impact of energy codes on commercial buildings and identify opportunities for savings through increased compliance.
	The Energy Office also completed an evaluation of recently built homes for energy code compliance in 2012. One hundred homes in 18 counties (only 44 homes were needed for a statistically valid sample) were evaluated by a RESNET Certified Home Energy Rater. In aggregate, the state average of energy code compliance was 64.7 percent. The highest compliance score was 83.67 percent, the lowest was 42.55 percent. Regional compliance rates were also calculated. By using a larger sample, the agency was able to evaluate homes in smaller code jurisdictions which was essential in designing specific training to address code jurisdiction staff deficiencies. The Energy Office also assisted in a code compliance study conducted by the Institute for Market Transformation. The study of 42 Nebraska homes in the three metropolitan counties (where 75 percent of new residential construction occurs) was completed in June 2013. The study also provides an assessment of the effectiveness of the localized, customized, one-on-one training being provided to codes staff members by an Energy Office contractor (retired codes official). This study estimated that the training provided had increased compliance by about 9 percent, or a state wide average of 75 percent compliance.
	Utility Involvement: The state’s three largest publicly-owned electric utilities – Lincoln Electric System, Nebraska Public Power District and Omaha Public Power District – have a long history of providing very strong support (financial and in-kind) for building energy code upgrades, training, and code compliance activities. In the most recent example, Omaha Public Power District provided $10,000 in support of the Great Plains Energy Codes Conference. In the past, all of the utilities have provided financing, conference facilities and other types of support.
	Stakeholder Advisory Group: The Nebraska Energy Code Compliance Collaborative (NECCC) was created in March 2013 to support achievement of the goal of full compliance with building energy codes that meet or exceed the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code. The Collaborative meets at least quarterly and continues to work at the committee level on issues of relevance such as training and funding sources.
	Training/Outreach: State Statute 81-1620 requires the State Energy Office to establish a training program to provide initial technical assistance to local code officials and residential and commercial builders upon adoption and implementation of a new Nebraska Energy Code.  That program must include the training of local code officials in building technology and local enforcement procedure related to implementation of the Nebraska Energy Code and the development of training programs suitable for presentation by local governments, educational institutions, and other public or private entities.

The three investor-owned electric utilities (Cleco, Entergy Louisiana/Gulf States, and SWEPCO) began implementing energy efficiency programs, along with an LCFC mechanism, in November 2014. Gas utilities chose not to file efficiency programs.

In New Orleans, there is a rate rider that provides for recovery of lost contribution to fixed costs for the electric and gas utility, Entergy. The lost contribution estimate is the product of the adjusted gross margin per kWh and the total annual projected savings. There is currently no policy in place at the state level that decouples utility profits from sales.

Also in New Orleans, there is a rate rider that includes an incentive mechanism for the electric and gas utility, Entergy. To be eligible for an incentive the utility must achieve 75% or greater of its approved savings goal. The incentive is based on a sliding scale and is a percentage of the utilities approved return on equity. The incentive is capped at 125% of the annual projected savings goal.

The LPSC Quick Start Energy Efficiency rules do not authorize utility shareholder incentive mechanism for efficiency; however, it does list the topic for discussion during the Phase II Comprehensive program phase.
