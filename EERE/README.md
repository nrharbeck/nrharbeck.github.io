The files used to create the G20 Spending website use a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, D3.js and Highcharts JavaScript library. Data files were sourced from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy and can be found in the 'Data' folder. The 'ACEEE_Scorecard_2019.csv' and 'DSIRE_Program_data.csv' files contain the raw original data that was processed and used in this project.
