The files used to create the website use a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, D3.js and tensorflowjs JavaScript libraries. Data files were sourced from the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE) and the Energy Information Administration's Open Data API. Data was processed and formatted with python 3.8. The PrepareInputs.py file in the 'Data' folder finds the most recent net generation for each state and its 19 fuel sources and saves it in the tensorflow model input format.

All images were created by Nick Harbeck.
